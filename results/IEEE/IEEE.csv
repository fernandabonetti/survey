EC6,[keynote 2] Paving the way towards nfv: An infrastructure based approach,2017,"2017 International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage (NAS)",T. Li,,,1,2,"Summary form only give, as follows. Provides an abstract of the keynote presentation and a brief professional biography of the presenter. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an initiative driven by the largest service providers (SP) to increase the use of virtualization and integrate intelligence into their network infrastructures. NFV leverages virtualization technology and operates network functions on standard servers to fundamentally decouple the customized and inflexible network hardware. Today, NFV provides a plethora of virtual network functions (VNFs), including gateways, mobile core, deep packet inspection (DPI), security, routing, and traffic management that can be combined to deliver the dynamic customized network service chains. Our exploration on both VM-based and container-based VNFs indicates that the service chaining can pose various challenges to NFV implementation on current commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) server. First, we observe that the NFV packet processing on COTS server exhibits a unique processing pattern - heterogeneous software pipeline, where the NFV traffic flows are processed by a variety of software components sequentially. On modern NUMA-based architecture, the end-to-end performance of NFV traffic flows can be severely affected by placing these heterogeneous software components inappropriately. We develop a thread scheduling mechanism that collaboratively places threads of heterogeneous software pipeline to minimize the end-to-end performance slowdown for NFV traffic flows. In the second part, we characterize the light-weight container-based VNF, which is expected to achieve shorter VNF provisioning time and lower resource overheads. However, we observe that the traffic flow processing in the shared host OS network stack involves a large amount of intermediate memory buffers and results in significant last level cache pollution. We propose NetContainer, a framework that achieves a fine-grained hardware resource management for containerized NFV platform. NetContainer exploits a cache access overhead guided page coloring technique to coordinately manage the inter/intra-flow cache access overheads.",10.1109/NAS.2017.8026632,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8026632,,,,,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC3,Delay-Aware Scheduling and Resource Optimization With Network Function Virtualization,2016,IEEE Transactions on Communications,L. Qu; C. Assi; K. Shaban,64,9,3746,3758,"To accelerate the implementation of network functions/middle boxes and reduce the deployment cost, recently, the concept of network function virtualization (NFV) has emerged and become a topic of much interest attracting the attention of researchers from both industry and academia. Unlike the traditional implementation of network functions, a software-oriented approach for virtual network functions (VNFs) creates more flexible and dynamic network services to meet a more diversified demand. Software-oriented network functions bring along a series of research challenges, such as VNF management and orchestration, service chaining, VNF scheduling for low latency and efficient virtual network resource allocation with NFV infrastructure, among others. In this paper, we study the VNF scheduling problem and the corresponding resource optimization solutions. Here, the VNF scheduling problem is defined as a series of scheduling decisions for network services on network functions and activating the various VNFs to process the arriving traffic. We consider VNF transmission and processing delays and formulate the joint problem of VNF scheduling and traffic steering as a mixed integer linear program. Our objective is to minimize the makespan/latency of the overall VNFs' schedule. Reducing the scheduling latency enables cloud operators to service (and admit) more customers, and cater to services with stringent delay requirements, thereby increasing operators' revenues. Owing to the complexity of the problem, we develop a genetic algorithm-based method for solving the problem efficiently. Finally, the effectiveness of our heuristic algorithm is verified through numerical evaluation. We show that dynamically adjusting the bandwidths on virtual links connecting virtual machines, hosting the network functions, reduces the schedule makespan by 15%-20% in the simulated scenarios.",10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2580150,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490404,Network function virtualization;scheduling;bandwidth allocation;genetic algorithm,Delays;Optimal scheduling;Bandwidth;Job shop scheduling;Channel allocation,69,30,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yang,7,,39721,39730,"Currently, software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) are the two most promising approaches for implementing network virtualization (NV). Traditional TCP/IP-based networks (e.g. Internet) will be transformed into SDN/NFV-enabled networks in the foreseeable future. Through virtualization, the slicing of heterogeneous underlying resources will provide an agile and customized virtual network (VN) services to end users. Hence, the virtual network function (VNF) embedding and scheduling are crucial to the VN service deployment in the SDN/NFV-enabled networks. In this paper, the dynamic VNF embedding and scheduling are jointly researched for enhancing the VN service provisioning. At first, the VNF embedding and scheduling are formulated by using the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, having the goals of minimizing the consumed underlying resources and providing QoS-guaranteed VN service. Subsequently, to remove the NP-hardness of the MILP model, a dynamic VNF embedding and scheduling algorithm is proposed. For instance, when a new VN service is requested, the VNFs, constituting the service function chain (SFC) of the VN service, will be embedded and scheduled by the proposed algorithm. If the resource and QoS requirements of the VNFs are not satisfied, a re-embedding and re-scheduling scheme will be triggered in order to optimize certain existing VNFs.

OK,Elastic Virtual Network Function Orchestration Policy Based on Workload Prediction,2019,IEEE Access,Y. Gu; Y. Hu; Y. Ding; J. Lu; J. Xie,7,,96868,96878,"By separating network functions from hardware-dependent middleboxes, network function virtualization (NFV) is expected to lead to significant cost reduction and the flexibility improvement in network management. Elastic orchestration of virtual network functions (VNF) is a key factor to achieve NFV goals. However, most existing VNF orchestration researches are limited to offline policy, ignoring the dynamic characteristics of the workload. To reduce the operational expenditure of NFV providers, this paper proposes an Elastic Virtual Network Function Orchestration (EVNFO) policy based on workload prediction. We adapt the online learning algorithm for predicting the flows rate of service function chains (SFC), which can help to obtain the VNF scaling decision. We further design the online instance provisioning strategy (OIPS) to accomplish the deployment of VNF instances according to the decision. The simulation proves that EVNFO can provide good performance with dynamic resource provision. The throughput of VNF is improved by 11.1%-22.9%, and the total operational expenditure can be reduced by 13.8% compared with other online approaches.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929260,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764539,Service function chain;scaling;elastic orchestrating;online learning,Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Mathematical model;Network function virtualization;Heuristic algorithms;Middleboxes;Resource management,,32,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC2,COMPARE: Comparative Advantage driven resource allocation for Virtual Network Functions,2016,2016 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN),B. A. Huberman; P. Sharma,,,212,218,"As Communication Service Providers (CSPs) adopt the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm they need to transition their network function capacity to a virtualized infrastructure with different Network Functions (NFs) running on a set of heterogeneous servers. This paper describes a novel technique for allocating server resources (compute, storage and network) for a given set of Virtual Network Function (VNF) requirements. Our approach helps the telecommunication providers decide the most effective way to run several VNFs on servers with different performance characteristics. Our analysis of prior VNF performance characterization on heterogeneous/different server resource allocations shows that the ability to arbitrarily create many VNFs among different servers' resource allocations leads to a comparative advantage among servers. We propose a VNF resource allocation method called COMPARE that maximizes the total throughput of the system by formulating this resource allocation problem as a comparative advantage problem among heterogeneous servers. There are several applications for using the VNF resource allocation from COMPARE including transitioning current Telco deployments to NFV based solutions and providing initial VNF placement for Service Function Chain (SFC) provisioning.

Ahmed,13,2,240,252,"Network function virtualization (NFV) sits firmly on the networking evolutionary path. By migrating network functions from dedicated devices to general purpose computing platforms, NFV can help reduce the cost to deploy and operate large IT infrastructures. In particular, NFV is expected to play a pivotal role in mobile networks where significant cost reductions can be obtained by dynamically deploying and scaling virtual network functions (VNFs) in the core network. However, in order to achieve its full potential, NFV needs to extend its reach also to the radio access segment. Here, mobile virtual network operators shall be allowed to request radio access VNFs with custom resource allocation solutions. Such a requirement raises several challenges in terms of performance isolation and resource provisioning. In this work, we formalize the wireless VNF placement problem in the radio access network as an integer linear programming problem and we propose a VNF placement heuristic, named wireless network embedding (WiNE), to solve the problem.

OK,A Deep Learning Approach to VNF Resource Prediction using Correlation between VNFs,2019,2019 IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft),H. Kim; S. Jeong; D. Lee; H. Choi; J. Yoo; J. W.

Specifically, these new network paradigms help manage the network environment dynamically and cost-efficiently. Virtual Network Function (VNF) and Service Function Chaining (SFC) are important aspects of the NFV environment. In terms of NFV management, resource demand of VNFs can be predicted at a future time to handle Quality of Service (QoS) and resource allocation problems efficiently. Hence, researchers study and build a management system where machine-learning-based predictions of VNF information are used to handle auto-scaling, deployment and migration of VNFs. In addition, in recent studies, these systems have involved SFC to obtain useful information, not just a lone VNF. However, not many of studies explain clearly how chaining dependency among VNFs in a SFC can be used to predict future resource demand of a VNF. In this paper, we introduce VNF resource prediction machine learning model that maximizes the benefits of using SFC.

EC2,Reliability-Aware Service Chaining In Carrier-Grade Softwarized Networks,2018,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,L. Qu; M. Khabbaz; C. Assi,36,3,558,573,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has revolutionized service provisioning in cloud datacenter networks. It enables the complete decoupling of Network Functions (NFs) from the physical hardware middle boxes that network operators deploy for implementing service-specific and strictly ordered NF chains. Precisely, NFV allows for dispatching NFs as instances of plain software called virtual network functions (VNFs) running on virtual machines hosted by one or more industry standard physical machines. Nevertheless, NF softwarization introduces processing vulnerability (e.g., failures caused by hardware or software, and so on). Since any failure of VNFs could break down an entire service chain, thus interrupting the service, the functionality of an NFV-enabled network will require a higher reliability compared with traditional networks. This paper encloses an in-depth investigation of a reliability-aware joint VNF chain placement and flow routing optimization. In order to guarantee the required reliability, an incremental approach is proposed to determine the number of required VNF backups. Through illustration, it is shown herein that the formulated single path routing model can be easily extended to support resource sharing between adjacent backup VNF instances. This paper advocates the absolute existence of a share-resource-based VNF assignment strategy that is capable of trading off all of the reliability, bandwidth, and computing resources consumption of a given service chain. A heuristic is proposed to work around the complexity of the presently formulated integer linear programming (ILP). Thorough numerical analysis and simulations are conducted in order to verify and assert the validity, correctness, and effectiveness of this proposed heuristic reflecting its ability to achieve very close results to those obtained through the resolution of the complex ILP within a negligible amount of time. Above and beyond, the proposed resource-sharing-based VNF placement scheme outperforms existing resource-sharing agnostic schemes by 15. 6% and 14.7% in terms of bandwidth and CPU utilization respectively.",10.1109/JSAC.2018.2815338,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8314675,Network functions virtualization;reliability;cloud datacenter;optimization;routing;VNF;NFV,Reliability;Middleboxes;Routing;Hardware;Software;Optimization;Navigation,12,28,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC2,Resilient virtual network mapping against large-scale regional failures,2017,2017 26th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC),C. Galdamez; Z. Ye,,,1,4,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies enable a fast way of deploying network services by instant initialization of virtual network functions on standardized commodity hardware, and a flexible network control and management via dynamic reconfigurations over open protocols. In particular, virtual networks from distinct tenants can be provisioned on the same physical network infrastructure to share the computing and networking resources through a process called virtual network mapping, which can lead to an efficient utilization of the underlying physical resources while guaranteeing the service isolation and performance efficiency. In the process of provisioning virtual networks, it is critically important to ensure that the virtual network services are resilient and they have the capability to continue functioning well in case of various failures such as fiber cuts, natural disasters and malicious attacks. In this paper, we study the problem of resilient virtual network mapping against large-scale regional failures, which are more challenging than existing network survivability designs in terms of single node/link failures or shared risk link group failures. We propose a novel region-disjoint mapping (RDM) algorithm which can map the primary and backup virtual networks into nonoverlapping geographical areas to survive large-scale regional failures. More specifically, the RDM algorithm adopts (1) the backtracking techniques to ensure the disjointness of the primary and backup virtual networks, and (2) the Suurballe's algorithm to jointly optimize the mapping of primary and backup virtual networks in one-step.

In order to satisfy the required QoS of serving users, each network slice deploys appropriate VNFs on different Base Stations (BSs) and orchestrates them for providing uniform service like an independent virtual network. However, due to the user mobility, the VNF on the BS may not have sufficient resource to provide QoS guaranteed services for newly accessed users. It is challenging to allocate adequate resource dynamically for VNFs to guarantee the required QoS of roaming users. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource allocation scheme for VNF based on group mobility prediction. We first employ Markov chain and online learning method together to predict group mobility of users. Then we calculate the popularities of BSs for allocating more resource to the hotspot BSs (HBSs) with aim of enabling HBS permit the enormous service requests of approaching users.

EC2,NFV Resource Allocation Using Mixed Queuing Network Model,2016,2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),M. S. Yoon; A. E. Kamal,,,1,6,"Network resource virtualization emerged as the future of communication technology recently, and the advent of Software Define Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enables the realization of network resource virtualization. NFV virtualizes traditional physical middle-boxes that implement specific network functions. Since multiple network functions can be virtualized in a single server or data center, the network operator can save Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) through NFV. Since each customer demands different types of VNFs with various applications, the service requirements are different for all VNFs. Therefore, allocating multiple Virtual Network Functions(VNFs) to limited network resource requires efficient resource allocation. We propose an efficient resource allocation strategy of VNFs in a single server by employing mixed queuing network model while minimizing the customers' waiting time in the system. The problem is formulated as a convex problem. However, this problem is impossible to be solved because of the closed queuing network calculation. So we use an approximation algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical results of this model show performance metrics of mixed queuing network.

To reduce such network latency, existing solutions only consider the maximum capacity of individual virtual network functions (VNFs) and do not take into account the fact that performance of VNFs, as with any software applications, is bottlenecked by either CPU or I/O peripheral capacity of the server they run on and their underneath implementation such as singleor multi-threaded.By exploiting this knowledge, we can better determine the number of required VNF instances and distribute the network traffic among them for any given VNF chain.

Current NFV approaches are limited to mapping the different VNF to the physical substrate subject to resource capacity constraints. They do not provide the possibility to define location requirements with a certain granularity and constraints on the colocation of VNF and virtual edges. Nevertheless, many scenarios can be envisioned in which a service provider (SP) would like to attach placement constraints for efficiency, resilience, legislative, privacy, and economic reasons. Therefore, we propose a set of affinity and anti-affinity constraints, which can be used by SP to define such placement restrictions. Furthermore, a semantic SFC validation framework is proposed that allows the virtual network function infrastructure provider (VNFInP) to check the validity of a set of constraints and provide feedback to the SPs. This allows the VNFInP to filter out any non-valid SFC requests before sending them to the mapping algorithm, significantly reducing the mapping time.",10.1109/TNSM.2017.2681025,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875160,Network function virtualization;software defined networking;semantic technology,Semantics;Resource management;Cloud computing;Virtualization;Privacy;Resilience;Hardware,8,35,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining it with Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables us to chain network services much easier and faster. The main idea of using these technologies is to consolidate several Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) into a fewer number of commodity servers to reduce costs, increase VNFs fluidity and improve resource efficiency. However, the resource allocation and placement of VNFs in the network is a multifaceted decision problem that depends on many factors, including VNFs resource demand characteristics, arrival rate, configuration of underlying infrastructure, available resources and agreed Quality of Services (QoS) in Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

Fung,,,1,7,"By moving network functions from dedicated hardware to software, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is expected to bring the advantages of cloud computing to network management. Frequent workload changes require the underlying infrastructure to be dynamic and agile to cope with the changes. Some existing studies have investigated elastic virtual machine (VM) positioning solutions by dynamically creating and destroying VM replicas, while maintaining balanced workload among VMs. However, those solutions are coarse-grained which may cause unnecessary resource over-provisioning and low resource utilization. In this paper, we propose ElasticNFV, a dynamic solution that achieves fine-grained cloud resource provisioning for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). ElasticNFV analyzes realtime resource demand of multiple service chains and allocates resource through an elastic provision mechanism. When a scaling conflict occurs, ElasticNFV provides a Two-Phase Minimal Migration (TPMM) algorithm to optimize migration time and embedding cost of VNFs based on prediction. We implemented ElasticNFV on top of a KVM virtualization platform and Open vSwitch.

Jukan,,,1,6,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new paradigm, enabling service innovation through virtualization of traditional network functions located flexibly in the network in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Since VNFs can only be placed onto servers located in networked data centers, which is the NFV's salient feature, the traffic directed to these data center areas has significant impact on network load balancing. Network load balancing can be even more critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service Function Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. To balance the network load, VNF's can be placed in a smaller cluster of servers in the network thus minimizing the distance to the data center. The optimization of the placement of these clusters is a challenge as also other factors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address this issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and especially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network. We design and compare three optimization methods, including Linear Programing (LP) model, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Fit Placement Algorithm (RFPA) for the allocation and replication of VNFs.

A major topic in the field of NFV research is the allocation and orchestration of VNF instances to provide satisfying network services according to user demands. The paper proposes and investigates a new solution for a scalable NFV Orchestrator allowing for a reduction of the needed time for the Service Function Chain routing and the allocation of cloud and bandwidth resources. That is obtained by abstracting and simplifying in the NFV orchestrator the knowledge of both the network topology and the resource amount available in the datacenters in which the Virtual Network Functions are executed. The solution is based on the Segment Routing paradigm that allows to implement the scalable orchestration at data plane level.

Gupta,4,,8084,8094,"Network function virtualization (NFV) has already been a new paradigm for network architectures. By migrating NFs from dedicated hardware to virtualization platform, NFV can effectively improve the flexibility to deploy and manage service function chains (SFCs). However, resource allocation for requested SFC in NFV-based infrastructures is not trivial as it mainly consists of three phases: virtual network functions (VNFs) chain composition, VNFs forwarding graph embedding, and VNFs scheduling. The decision of these three phases can be mutually dependent, which also makes it a tough task. Therefore, a coordinated approach is studied in this paper to jointly optimize NFV resource allocation in these three phases. We apply a general cost model to consider both network costs and service performance. The coordinate NFV-RA is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming, and a heuristic-based algorithm (JoraNFV) is proposed to get the near optimal solution. To make the coordinated NFV-RA more tractable, JoraNFV is divided into two sub-algorithms, one-hop optimal traffic scheduling and a multi-path greedy algorithm for VNF chain composition and VNF forwarding graph embedding. Last, extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of JoraNFV, and results have shown that JoraNFV can get a solution within 1.25 times of the optimal solution with reasonable execution time, which indicates that JoraNFV can be used for online NFV planning.",10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2629278,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7747433,NFV;resource allocation;service function chain;traffic scheduling;virtual function placement,Resource management;Noise measurement;Telecommunication traffic;Scheduling;Mix integer linear programming;Virtual function placement,45,28,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC2,Reliability-Aware Service Function Chaining With Function Decomposition and Multipath Routing,2019,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,L. Qu; C. Assi; M. Khabbaz; Y. Ye,PP,99,1,1,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) converts network functions executed by costly middleboxes into instances of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) hosted by industry-standard Physical Machines (PMs). This has proven to be quite an efficient approach when it comes to enabling automated network operations and the elastic provisioning of resources to support heterogeneous services. Today’s revolutionary services impose a remarkably elevated reliability together with ultra-low latency requirements. Therefore, in addition to having highly reliable VNFs, these VNFs have to be optimally placed in such a way to rapidly route traffic among them with the least utilization of bandwidth. Hence, the proper selection of PMs to meet the above-mentioned reliability and delay requirements becomes a remarkably challenging problem. None of the existing publications addressing such a problem concurrently adopts VNF decomposition to enhance the flexibility of the VNFs’ placement and a hybrid routing scheme to achieve an optimal trade-off between the above-mentioned objectives. In this paper, a VNF-decomposition-based backup strategy is proposed together with a delay-aware hybrid multipath routing scheme for enhancing the reliability of NFV-enabled network services while jointly reducing delays these services experience. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) whose resolution yields an optimal VNF placement and traffic routing policy. Next, the delay-aware hybrid shortest path-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to work around the MILP’s complexity.

Bai; R. Boutaba; J. François,,,152,160,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has gained a significant research interest in both academia and industry since its inception in the late 2012. One of the key research issues in NFV is the development of systems for building Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) capable of meeting the performance requirements of enterprise and telecommunication networks. New packet processing models leveraging kernel bypass I/O and poll-mode processing have gained popularity for building high performance VNFs because of their simple programming model and very low I/O overhead. However, a major drawback of such poll-mode processing is the inefficient use of CPU resources. Existing CPU schedulers are ill-suited for VNFs due to their inability to capture the actual processing cost of a poll-mode VNF, hence, cannot rightsize the CPU allocation. This is further exacerbated by their inability to consider VNF processing order when VNFs are chained to form Service Function Chains (SFCs). The state-of-the-art solutions proposed for VNF scheduling are intrusive, i.e., requiring the VNFs to be built with scheduler specific libraries or having carefully selected scheduling checkpoints. This highly restricts the VNFs that can properly work with such schedulers. In this paper, we present UNi S: a User-space Non-intrusive work-flow aware VNF Scheduler. Unlike existing approaches, UNi S does not require VNF modifications and treats the poll-mode VNFs as a black box, hence, is non-intrusive. UNi S is also workflow-aware, i.e., maintains SFC processing order while scheduling the VNFs. Testbed experiments show that UNiS is able to achieve a throughput within 90% (for synthetic traffic load) and 98% (for real data center traffic trace) of the achievable throughput using an intrusive co-operative scheduler.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8584987,,Libraries;Kernel;Throughput;Hardware;Linux;Job shop scheduling,,40,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite consistent initial efforts to make NFV a reality, little has been done towards efficiently placing virtual network functions and deploying service function chains (SFC). With respect to this particular research problem, it is important to make sure resource allocation is carefully performed and orchestrated, preventing over- or under-provisioning of resources and keeping end-to-end delays comparable to those observed in traditional middlebox-based networks.

It is a challenge to optimally select and chain VNF instances from the multi-instances. Moreover, due to the capacity limitation of the distributed edge nodes. The capacity of the Virtual Machines (VMs) that host VNFs should be proactively adjusted to cope with traffic demands.

Furthermore, we formulate the adaptive VNF resource allocation (VNF-AR) problem as a convex optimization. The theoretical optimal capacity for each VM can be derived from the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. At last, a novel joint optimization approach of VNF chaining and adaptive scaling (VNF-CAS) is proposed to efficiently embed the SFC requests.

Ji,,,1,11,"Network function virtualization (NFV) is an emerging design paradigm that replaces physical middlebox devices with software modules running on general purpose commodity servers. While gradually transitioning to NFV, Internet service providers face the problem of where to introduce NFV in order to make the most benefit of that; here, we measure the benefit by the amount of traffic that can be serviced through the NFV. This problem is non-trivial as it is composed of two challenging subproblems: 1) placement of nodes to support virtual network functions (referred to as VNF-nodes); and 2) allocation of the VNF-nodes resources to network flows; the two subproblems need to be considered jointly to satisfy the objective of serving the maximum amount of traffic. This problem has been studied recently but for the one-dimensional setting, where all network flows require one network function, which requires a unit of resource to process a unit of flow. In this work, we extend to the multi-dimensional setting, where flows can require multiple network functions, which can also require a different amount of each resource to process a unit of flow. The multi-dimensional setting introduces new challenges in addition to those of the onedimensional setting (e.g., NP-hardness and non-submodularity) and also makes the resource allocation a multi-dimensional generalization of the generalized assignment problem with assignment restrictions.

Lau,35,2,392,406,"With the recent advent of network functions virtualization (NFV), enterprises and businesses are looking into network service provisioning through the service chains of virtual network functions (VNFs), instead of relying on dedicated hardware middleboxes. Accompanying this trend, an NFV market is emerging, where NFV service providers create VNF instances, assemble VNF service chains, and sell them for the use of customers, using resources (computing, bandwidth) that they own or rent from other resource suppliers. Efficient service chain provisioning and pricing mechanisms are still missing, to charge assembled service chains according to demand and the supply of resources at any time. We propose an online stochastic auction mechanism for on-demand service chain provisioning and pricing at an NFV provider. Our auction takes in buy bids for service chains from multiple customers and sell bids from various resource suppliers to supplement the NFV provider's geo-distributed resource pool, with resource occupation/contribution durations. We extend online primal-dual optimization framework for handling both buyers and sellers, with a new competitive analysis. The online mechanism maximizes the expected social welfare of the NFV ecosystem (the NFV provider, customers and resource suppliers) with a good competitive ratio as compared with the expected offline optimal social welfare, while guaranteeing truthfulness in bidding, individual rationality for both buyers and sellers, and polynomial time for computation. We evaluate our mechanism through trace-driven simulation studies, and demonstrate a close-to-offline-optimal performance in expected social welfare under realistic settings.",10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659259,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837618,Auction mechanism design;online algorithms;network functions virtualization,Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Pricing;Network function virtualization;Heuristic algorithms;Hardware;Optimization,13,32,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the condition of a large number of various user service requests reach the network in a short time, dynamic placement of VNFs is essential to achieve efficient physical resource allocation, while ensuring network stability. Unlike queue models in current works, we design a dynamic scheduling model of two-stage queue to perceive the status of current queue backlog and schedule the queue dynamically. In particular, we formulate a VNF placement cost minimization problem, taking the network stability into account. Owing to that the problem belongs to an NP-hard problem, we transform it into the minimization of the upper bound of the drift-plus-penalty function by the Lyapunov optimization technique. Then, we decompose the reformulated problem into a service function chain (SFC) scheduling problem and an SFC mapping problem, corresponding to our designed dynamic scheduling model of two-stage queue. For the abovementioned two problems, we present a queue-aware dynamic placement of virtual network functions algorithm.

Typically, the management data structure uses a hierarchical namespace containing tens of thousands of object identifiers (OID). Each OID identifies a variable that can be read, modified or set via management protocol. The British Telecom network collects many millions of OIDs every 10 minutes, and executes many thousands of configuration changes per month via many tools, and multiple generations of protocols, data models and software components.

Recent studies reveal that although this migration of network function brings the network operation unprecedented flexibility and controllability, NFV-based architecture suffers from serious performance degradation compared with traditional service provisioning on dedicated devices. In order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the service provisioning capability of NFV, this paper proposes a novel analytical model based on Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to quantitatively investigate the end-to-end performance bound of the NFV networks. To capture the dynamic and on-demand NFV features, both the non-bursty traffic, e.g., the Poisson process, and the bursty traffic, e.g., the Markov Modulated Poisson Process, are jointly considered in the developed model to characterize the arriving traffic. To address the challenges of resource competition and end-to-end NFV chaining, the property of convolution associativity and leftover service technologies of SNC are exploited to calculate the available resources of the Virtual Network Function nodes in the presence of multiple competing traffic and transfer the complex NFV chain into an equivalent system for performance derivation and analysis. Both the numerical analysis and extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. Results demonstrate that the analytical performance metrics match well with those obtained from the simulation experiments and numerical analysis.

By decoupling the NFs from dedicated hardware to virtualized platform, NFV promises flexible deployment and management of service function chains (SFCs). However, an optimal resource allocation for requested SFC in NFV-based infrastructures should coordinately consider following three stages: virtual network functions (VNFs) chain composing, VNF forwarding graph embedding, and VNFs scheduling, which is a tough task as the decision of these three phases is mutually dependent. In this paper, staring from the challenges in solving coordinated NFV resource allocation (NFV-RA), we first formulate a typical three-stage coordinated NFV-RA model as a mixed integer programming (MIP) and, then, propose a heuristic solution called merge-split viterbi (MSV). MSV can automatically determine the appropriate number of VNF instances without given maximum number threshold, and it does not take the iterative deployment strategy, which is commonly used in current solutions. The main idea of MSV is to first find a global basic solution and, then, to further optimize the basic solution through some improvement procedures, and this makes it not be easily trapped in local optimality and avoid complex anti-local-optimal measures as well.

Since failure of each VNF leads to breaking down the entire service chain, it is critical that service providers offer guaranteed and highly available SFCs against the failures. Previous works for simplicity assumed a completely available network infrastructure or just one failure in a same time; further, they increase availability of a SFC by adding dedicated backups which is costly. Unlike previous works, we investigate the problem of guarantying the required availability of SFCs against the multiple failures in a same time with minimum resource consumption.

Musumeci; M. Tornatore,,,1,8,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has changed the way operators can provision network services. Decoupling network functions from dedicated hardware and running them on software, on top of commodity servers and switches, not only helps operators have more flexible and easy-to-manage networks, but also reduces their capital and operational expenditures. This is especially true for incoming 5G services, characterized by ultra-low latency, high reliability and bandwidth requirements. To satisfy these challenging requirements, multi-layer optical networks based on Optical Transport Network (OTN) over wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) are being deployed in the metro segment to support 5G services. In addition, the possibility to equip metro nodes with computing capabilities, enabled by new paradigms such as CORD (Central Office Re-architected as a Datacenter) is being exploited. In this scenario, an efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) for Service Chain (SC) provisioning within the metro network is needed, and different VNF placement strategies can lead to different costs for network operators. In this paper we analyze the impact of different VNF placement strategies on the optical metro network cost, considering specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements, expressed in terms of service blocking probability.

To accommodate dynamic traffic such as burst, NFV can scale virtual network functions (VNFs) across several physical servers, which is known as horizontal scaling, or enlarge the capacity of a VNF leveraging idle resources in one physical server, which is called vertical scaling. Vertical scaling should be used as much as possible to accommodate user traffic increment immediately, and horizontal scaling is only performed when vertical scaling cannot allocate sufficient resource to meet the demand. We find that just to reserve redundant resource is far from sufficient to enable vertical scaling with good performance, and VNF placement plays a crucial role. In this paper, we model the scalable VNF placement problem formally, and prove that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we develop two online heuristic algorithms gradually to solve the problem.

Hausheer,,,1,5,"Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a new paradigm to move network tasks currently running on dedicated, vendor-specific hardware to elastic, virtualized environments, similar to IaaS cloud computing. A major challenge of NFV is to reach the performance known from dedicated hardware appliances, which often leverage ASIC, FPGA or NPU-based hardware acceleration to increase throughput and reduce delay. In this paper, a framework for elastic provisioning, programming and configuration of acceleration hardware for virtual network functions (VNFs) is proposed.

Rao,6,1,692,704,"In this paper, an analytical end-to-end (E2E) packet delay modeling is established for multiple traffic flows traversing an embedded virtual network function (VNF) chain in fifth generation communication networks. The dominant-resource generalized processing sharing is employed to allocate both computing and transmission resources among flows at each network function virtualization (NFV) node to achieve dominant-resource fair allocation and high resource utilization. A tandem queueing model is developed to characterize packets of multiple flows passing through an NFV node and its outgoing transmission link. For analysis tractability, we decouple packet processing (and transmission) of different flows in the modeling and determine average packet processing and transmission rates of each flow as approximated service rates. An M/D/1 queueing model is developed to calculate packet delay for each flow at the first NFV node. Based on the analysis of packet interarrival time at the subsequent NFV node, we adopt an M/D/1 queueing model as an approximation to evaluate the average packet delay for each flow at each subsequent NFV node. The queueing model is proved to achieve more accurate delay evaluation than that using a G/D/1 queueing model. Packet transmission delay on each embedded virtual link between consecutive NFV nodes is also derived for E2E delay calculation.

Chiotakis; S. Pinneterre; M. Paolino,,,47,51,"The emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has turned dedicated hardware devices (routers, firewalls, wide area network accelerators) to Virtual Machines (VMs). However, the execution of these Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) in general purpose hardware brings slower performance and higher energy consumption. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a promising solution to improve performance and energy consumption thanks to their reconfigurable fabric and acceleration capabilities. These capabilities are in general made available to computing systems through the PCIe bus and the SR-IOV technology that enables a single PCIe device to offer multiple virtual interfaces (Virtual Functions or VFs) to the applications (or VMs). This brings static allocation of FPGA portions to each virtual machine, achieving best acceleration performance given by the direct communication of guests application with the FPGA fabric. Despite that, SR-IOV has a strong impact on the FPGA resources usage. In fact, the number of available VFs (i.e., interfaces for connection to the VMs) is limited in number and flexibility. This is a problem, especially in containerized or cloud native environments where several thousands of guests need to be run concurrently. In addition, static assignment of FPGA resources might not always be the best strategy, especially when the VNFs that are attached to VFs underutilize the FPGA resource. In that case, a VNF that rarely uses the FPGA prevents a new VNF from accessing the accelerators. This paper aims to address these limitations by assigning one FPGA's VF to multiple VNFs. To do this, we extended the SR-IOV based acceleration framework FPGA Virtualization Manager (vFPGAmanager) with VF sharing feature. The CPU-FPGA throughput performance of two containers using different hardware accelerators through the same VF has been measured. The results show a penalty of 30% when two VNFs request acceleration at the same time (worst case scenario). In the best case (i.e., when the VNFs don't concurrently request FPGA acceleration) close to native performance is achieved.",10.1109/EuCNC.2019.8802043,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802043,,,,19,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zhang,7,,173257,173272,"Network functions virtualization (NFV) is becoming a prevailing design for future Internet by migrating network functions from dedicated hardware appliances to software instances running in virtual computing platforms. NFV resource allocation approaches can dynamically instantiate network functions by using virtualized network functions (VNFs) to satisfy various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements with minimum network costs. The operator can launch a new VNF instance (VNFI) for each VNF required for flows, or assign it to the established VNFI. This makes NFV orchestration (NFVO) even more complicated. In addition, the challenges of developing NFVO scheme include how to manage the dependency between VNFs placement (network-level) and routing of flows (flow-level) through ordered VNFs, and how to efficiently utilize the available network resources. In this paper, ClusVNFI, a hierarchical resource allocation approach based on clustering, is proposed to address these challenges. To be specific, VNFs are proposed to be clustered based on their correlation. Then VNFs belonging to the same cluster are inclined to be deployed on one node to reduce the occupied link bandwidth. Moreover, network nodes are clustered based on the similarity on end-to-end flow latency information. Accordingly, flows in the same cluster intend to share the instantiated VNFIs, aiming at improving VNFI utilization while avoiding path stretch. By capturing the dependency between network-level and flow-level through clustering, ClusVNFI can achieve the tradeoff among multiple objectives including maximizing the number of admitted flows, minimizing path stretch, and improving VNFI utilization. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed ClusVNFI can balance multiple objectives comparing with other typical heuristic algorithms.

A key challenge of NFV is how to design a cost-effective VNF (Virtualized Network Function) deployment scheme. Most of the existing schemes deploy VNF based on resources requested by users and ignore optimizations during the running time, which causes low capacity utilization. Therefore, we propose an efficient VNF deployment scheme in this paper, which has two parts: over-deployment and automatic migration to improve resource utilization rate and guarantee on-demand capacity provisioning at the same time. The over-deployment approach takes advantage of the characteristic that resources actually used by VNFs are mostly less than the resources requested and deploys VNF based on running load. However, over-deployment may cause PMs (Physical Machines) overloaded at some time, thus, we use the automatic migration approach to solve the overload problem by migrating VNFs. The automatic migration approach moves proper VNFs to lighten the load of overloaded PMs. We perform extensive simulations and numerical results verify benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of the average number of deployed VNFs, active PMs, the rejection rate of VNF requests, and VNF migrations.",10.1109/ICCSN.2019.8905349,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8905349,VNF deployment;over-deployment;automatic migration,,,8,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cheriet,15,4,1363,1377,"The emerging paradigm of network function virtualization (NFV) technology promises an efficient solution for optimized service deployment in the cloud computing environment thanks to its ability to dynamically add or remove virtual resources when there is a change in workload. Nevertheless, telecom providers are still facing a challenging issue in efficiently adopting NFV to deploy Web real-time communication (WebRTC) service on top of IP multimedia subsystem (IMS). Providing WebRTC service increases the inherent complexity of the IMS system in terms of the number of service nodes as virtual network functions (VNFs) and the way they interact, both of which play significant roles in the problem of optimally allocating resources. This paper proposes a virtualized interworking system between IMS and WebRTC called NFV-based interworking architecture, and describes the mechanism for VNFs to exchange messages with each other. We present an analytic system model considering the constraints of resources, quality of service (QoS), and service costs. A real-time Markov approximation-based resource allocation algorithm (RIDRA) is then designed allowing a provisioned resource at service nodes to be reconfigured in time to meet performance requirements. The proposed solution is evaluated on the large scale by simulation and on the small scale by our developed testbed.

To fully exploit such a potential and reach higher network performance, resource management stages should be jointly performed. To this end, two main challenges are: how to present a system model that formulates the desired resource allocation problem for different types of SFCs as well as different features, and how to tackle the computational complexity of the problem and solve it in a tractable manner.

We detail the modeling of the game, discuss the existence of the Nash equilibrium states, and design an auxiliary graph-based heuristic algorithm for tenants to compute approximate equilibrium solutions in the games. A dynamic resource pricing strategy, which can set the prices of network resources in real time according to the actual network status, is also introduced for EO-IDCNs as a complementary method to the game-theoretic approach. Results from extensive simulations that consider both static network planning and dynamic service provisioning scenarios indicate that the proposed game-theoretic approach facilitates both higher tenant and network-wide profits and improves the network throughput as well compared with the baseline algorithms, while the dynamic pricing strategy can further reduce the request blocking probability with a factor of ~2.4×.",10.1364/JOCN.10.00A232,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293991,Broker-based;Elastic optical inter-datacenter networks (EO-IDCNs);Dynamic resource pricing;Mixed-strategy gaming;Virtual network function service chain (VNF-SC),Games;Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Pricing;Optimized production technology;Dynamic scheduling,5,,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of network function virtualization (NFV) to run network services in software enables software-defined networks (SDNs) to create a largely software-based network. To truly achieve the vision of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible, lower- cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is needed.Our high-performance NFV platform, OpenNetVM, enables high bandwidth network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers. OpenNetVM exploits Intel's DPDK libraries to minimize the overhead of packet processing, and to provide high throughput, low latency networking in virtualized environments. OpenNetVM allows true zero-copy delivery of data to VMs, both for packet processing and high-speed inter-VM communication through shared huge pages within a trust boundary. We envision a dynamic and flexible network that can support a smarter data plane than just simple switches that forward packets. We build on our OpenNetVM NFV platform by developing our SDNFV network architecture that supports complex stateful routing of flows where processing by network functions (NFs) can dynamically modify the path taken by flows, without unduly burdening the centralized SDN controller. The tutorial will also briefly touch upon the problem of dynamic placement of network functions and routing of flows through a software based network, exploiting a mixture of centralized SDN control and NFV capabilities in the network. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and heuristics can be used to solve the problem incrementally.As a case study, we examine the growing communication needs of 'Internet-of-Things' (IoT). With 'smart' sensing devices becoming ubiquitous, there is a need to support IoT communication at large scale, especially over cellular networks.

Akutsu; K. Baba,2,,25,30,"Service chaining composed of several different virtual network functions (VNFs) constitutes a use case of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). In a conventional method, the optimal allocation of VNFs and logical paths was resolved by using integer linear programming. However, because the approach did not consider that the required resources of each service differ, the residual resources of the links or physical machines were dispersed as the number of allocated services increased. Therefore, the method did not efficiently allocate resources to services requiring many resources.

Indeed, with the term Virtual Functions we refer to virtual computing as well as network service capabilities (e.g., routers and middlebox functions provided as Virtual Network Functions). In order to cope with the increasingly resource intensive demand, these virtual functions will be deployed in distributed clusters of small-scale datacenters typically located in current exchanges at the network edge and will supplement those deployed in traditional large cloud datacenters.

Proposed applications include high-definition, low-latency video streaming, remote surgery, as well as applications for tactile Internet, virtual or augmented reality that demand network side data processing (such as image recognition, transformation or head/eye motion aware rendering). One approach to support these use cases is to introduce virtualized network services at the edge of the network, in close proximity of the end users to reduce end-to-end latency, time-to-response and unnecessary utilization of the core network, while providing flexibility for resource allocation. While many research projects including our previous work on Glasgow Network Functions have proposed running virtual network functions (vNF)s at the network edge, a latency-optimal placement allocation has not been presented before for the network edge and therefore the impact on user-to-vNF latency has not been investigated. In this paper, we formulate a simple vNF placement problem that minimizes end-to-end latency from users to their network functions.

NS is an approach to network operations allowing the partition of a physical topology into multiple independent virtual networks, called network slices (or slices).

Traditional schemes for network resources provisioning based on static policies may lead to poor resource utilization and suffer from scalability issues. In this article, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for performing dynamic SFC resources allocation in NFV-SDN enabled metro-core optical networks. RL allows to build a self-learning system able to solve highly complex problems by employing RL agents to learn policies from an evolving network environment. In particular, we build an RL system able to optimize the resources allocation of SFCs in a multi-layer network (packet over flexi-grid optical layer).

The characteristics of virtualization provide service function chain (SFC) provisioning with the required flexibility by allowing for placing VNFs anywhere and anytime. However, there may be a large number of servers with low utilization across the network at the low-load time, leading to enormous loss of energy. VNF consolidation, as an effective way to address this issue, allows for energy saving by consolidating VNFs into as fewer servers as possible. Unfortunately, it involves multiple conflicting goals, such as energy saving, bandwidth usage minimization, and migration cost reduction, which makes it hard to implement in practical environments. In order to achieve the tradeoff among these goals, this paper proposes a VNF consolidation method, VCMM, which determines appropriate servers to be turned off by leveraging neural network with multiple network status characteristics as input. The neural network is trained using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). VCMM migrates VNFs on servers to be turned off by adopting a greedy mechanism.

This problem can be addressed by using survivable virtual network embedding (SVNE), more commonly with single-path provisioning (SPP) than multipath provisioning (MPP), although the former consumes more resources. However, only a few schemes consider using one-to-multi node mapping in SVNE. Now, one-to-multi node mapping and MPP scheme can be easily implemented in SVNE for software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technology. So, this paper investigates the feasibility of implementing the SVNE scheme, with MPP and one-to-multi node mapping, to achieve higher reliability and better efficiency in elastic optical network. This scheme considers four key points: 1) the number and resource requirement of physical nodes that carry one virtual node, 2) the spectrum requirement of each path of one virtual link, 3) the number of paths considering shared risk group, and 4) graph theory, which are used in the scheme.

To utilize the resources efficiently, an operator can share the same VNF instance for multiple SFCs. The CPU utilization of a VNF instance can increase when new flows are accepted. This may increase the VNF delay which can result in the violation of SLA requirements of the existing flows. Therefore, an efficient VNF selection to form SFCs while meeting the SLA requirements is an important aspect that needs to be addressed.

Jiang,15,4,1307,1321,"Network function virtualization (NFV) implements network middleboxes in software, enabling them to be more flexible and dynamic. NFV resource allocation methods can exploit the capabilities of virtualization to dynamically instantiate network functions (NFs) to adapt to traffic demand and network conditions. Deploying NFs requires decisions for NF placement, and routing of flows through these NFs in accordance with the sequence of NFs required to process each flow. The challenges in developing an NFV resource allocation scheme include the need to manage the dependency between flow-level (routing) and network-level (placement) decisions and to efficiently utilize resources that may be distributed network-wide, while fulfilling the performance requirements of flows. We propose a scalable resource allocation scheme, called ClusPR, that addresses these challenges. By elegantly capturing the dependency between flow routing and NF placement, ClusPR strikes a balance between multiple objectives including minimizing path stretch, balancing the load among NF instances, while maximizing the total network utilization by accommodating the maximum number of flows possible. ClusPR addresses the offline problem of NFV resource allocation. To address the online problem of dynamically placing and routing flows upon their arrival, we propose iClusPR. iClusPR is an online algorithm that performs dynamic scaling by adjusting the number of NF instances based on the traffic demand and the network state. Our experiments show that ClusPR achieves the near-optimal solution for a practical large-sized network in reasonable time.

EC4,Information-Centric Virtualization for Software-Defined Statistical QoS Provisioning Over 5G Multimedia Big Data Wireless Networks,2019,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,X. Zhang; Q. Zhu,37,8,1721,1738,"The multimedia transmission represents a typical big data application in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. However, supporting multimedia big data transmission over 5G wireless networks imposes many new and open challenges because multimedia big data services are both time-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive over time-varying wireless channels with constrained wireless resources. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose the information-centric virtualization architectures for software-defined statistical delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) provisioning over 5G multimedia big data wireless networks. In particular, our proposed schemes integrate the three 5G-promising candidate techniques to guarantee the statistical delay-bounded QoS for multimedia big data transmissions: 1) information-centric network (ICN), to derive the optimal in-network caching locations for multimedia big data; 2) network functions virtualization (NFV), to abstract the PHY-layer infrastructures into several virtualized networks to derive the optimal multimedia data contents delivery paths; and 3) software-defined networks (SDNs), to dynamically reconfigure wireless resources allocation architectures through the SDN-control plane. Under our proposed architectures, to jointly optimize the implementations of NFV and SDN techniques under ICN architectures, we develop the three virtual network selection and transmit-power allocation schemes to: 1) maximize single user's effective capacity; 2) jointly optimize the aggregate effective capacity and allocation fairness over all users; and 3) coordinate non-cooperative gaming among all users, respectively. By simulations and numerical analyses, we show that our proposed architectures and schemes significantly outperform the other existing schemes in supporting the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over the 5G multimedia big data wireless networks.",10.1109/JSAC.2019.2927088,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756123,5G multimedia big data wireless networks;ICN;NFV;SDN;optimal transmit power;statistical delay-bounded QoS;effective capacity;relay selection,Big Data;Quality of service;Wireless networks;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Wireless sensor networks,,38,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Musumeci; M. Tornatore,,,136,141,"The advent of new services with stringent requirements on bandwidth and latency has led to a downward curve in per-user revenues of telecom operators. This has stimulated a significant shift in the way operators provision their services, moving from the utilization of dedicated and static hardware to support network functions (as NATs, firewalls, etc.), to the deployment of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in the form of dynamically-reconfigurable virtual machines on low-cost servers and switches. These VNFs must be chained together and should be placed optimally to meet the Quality of Service requirements of the supported services. This problem consists in placing the VNFs and routing traffic sequentially among them and is known as Service Chaining (SC). Solving this problem dynamically based on how traffic evolves allows to achieve great flexibility in resource assignment in the existing infrastructure and to save operational expenditures. An effective algorithm for dynamic SC must promote consolidation in VNF placement (it is desirable to consolidate VNFs in the fewer possible number of network nodes), while maintaining low blocking probability and guaranteeing latency targets to the supported services. In this paper we propose an algorithm which performs dynamic SC in a metro-area network, while minimizing average number of nodes required to host VNF instances as well as the blocking probability. This algorithm can help telecom operators reduce their operational expenditures up to 50% by activating less nodes to host VNFs in the network, while maintaining an acceptable level of blocking probability.",10.23919/ONDM.2018.8396120,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396120,,Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Network topology;Delays;Bandwidth;Topology;Microprocessors,11,21,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lau,,,205,213,"Network function virtualization has emerged as a promising technology to enable rapid network service composition/innovation, energy conservation and cost minimization for network operators. To optimally operate a virtualized network service, it is of key importance to optimally deploy a VNF (virtualized network function) service chain within the provisioning infrastructure (e.g., servers and the network within a cloud datacenter), and dynamically scale it in response to flow traffic changes. Most of the existing work on VNF scaling assume access to precise network bandwidth information for placement decisions, while in reality, network bandwidth typically fluctuates following an unknown pattern and an effective way to adapt to it is to do trials. In this paper, we address dynamic VNF service chain deployment and scaling by a novel combination of an online provisioning algorithm and a multi-armed bandit optimization framework, which exploits online learning of the available bandwidths to enable optimal deployment of a scaled service chain. Specifically, we adopt the online algorithm to minimize the cost for provisioning VNF instances on the go, and a bandit-based online learning algorithm to place the VNF instances which minimizes the congestion in a datacenter network.

In NFV-enabled networks, inadequate placement of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) creates bottlenecks, impacting negatively on performance. Therefore, network operators must establish affinity and anti-affinity rules to avoid network and processing bottlenecks, and thus comply with Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements of tenants. Affinity and anti-affinity rules in NFV must be broad and carefully elaborated to maintain service performance. Network operators must consider further than simply resource allocation when identifying affinity among VNFs. The criteria for VNFs affinity varies for different forwarding graphs. Geolocation, latency, packet loss, and bandwidth usage are some examples of criteria that can be considered as indicators of bottlenecks in high traffic networks. In this paper, we propose a solution to measure affinity between pairs of VNFs, based on a weighted set of affinity criteria considered relevant by a network operator. To evaluate the feasibility of our affinity model, we analyze three case studies over an experimental NFV scenario. We conclude that our affinity model can help network operators identify the cause of issues in NFV-enabled networks, as well as it may be used by NFV orchestrators to aid on VNFs migration and embedding.",10.23919/INM.2017.7987272,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987272,,Bandwidth,2,14,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yazdani,PP,99,1,1,"Service Function Chain (SFC) provides an end-to-end service by processing traffic flow through a series of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a specific order. Satisfying user’s demands (e.g, end-to-end delay) on one hand and minimizing the cost of SFC deployment in terms of energy and resource on the other hand, introduces VNFs placement as a crucial issue that is receiving significant attention by researchers. To address this problem and boost the performance of SFC, different techniques such as Network Function (NF) distribution, NF parallelism and optimal resource allocation have been utilized. Applying these mechanisms imposes other costs which must be taken into account by network providers. In this paper, we introduce CoDeC as a Cost-effective and Delay-aware resource allocation approach. By having user defined end-to-end threshold and using aforementioned mechanisms, CoDeC tries to place the requested VNFs with the minimum cost of deployment, distribution, parallelism and energy. Therefore, we formulate the addressed problem in form of Mixed Integer linear Programming (MILP) model. We then show that the problem is NP-complete and suffers from high time complexity in large-scale scenarios.

Sieber; W. Kellerer,,,1,9,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims to virtualize compute resources for packet processing in order to gain flexibility and reduce costs. In order to increase the resource utilization, multiple VNFs are co-located on one single server. Current virtualization techniques do not fully isolate all resources, thus co-location of VNFs causes interference effects. It has been shown that these interference effects can degrade the performance of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in terms of throughput and delay severely. In this work we aim to gather the potential that lies in reduction of the interference due to the shared Last Level Cache (LLC). CPU caches are used to improve the access times to memory that is needed regularly for the execution of a program. Intel Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) provides the means to allocate the cache and isolate VNFs from each other. The results show that the scheduler can decrease the CPU utilization by up to 20%.

Cao; H. Yu; C. Qiao,7,9,942,951,"Network function virtualization (NFV) provides an effective way to reduce the network provider's cost by allowing multiple virtual networks (VNs) to share the underlying physical infrastructure. In the NFV environment, especially when supporting multicast services over the VNs, reliability is a critical requirement since the failure of one virtual node can cause the malfunction of multiple nodes that receive multicasting data from it. In this paper, we study for the first time to the best of our knowledge how to efficiently map VNs for multicast services over both general IP networks and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based elastic optical networks (EONs) while taking into consideration the max-min fairness in terms of reliability among distinct VNs. For general IP networks, we propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to determine the upper bound on the reliability with max-min fairness. In addition, an efficient heuristic, namely a reliability-aware genetic (RAG) algorithm, is developed to address reliable multicast VN mapping with a low computational complexity. By encoding multicast tree construction and link mapping into the process of path selection, taking into consideration the reliability with max-min fairness, and the networking reliability factors during mutation, RAG can globally optimize the reliability and fairness of all the multicast VN requests. For OFDM-based EONs, we extend the MILP (RAG) to optical-MILP [(O-MILP) optical RAG (O-RAG)] by considering the most efficient modulation format selection strategy, spectrum continuity, and conflict constraints. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that RAG (O-RAG) achieves close to the optimal reliability fairness with a much lower time complexity than the MILP (O-MILP) model. In particular, the path reliability-based mutation strategy in RAG (O-RAG) yields a significant performance improvement over other heuristic solutions in terms of reliability fairness, bandwidth (spectrum) consumption, and transmission delay.",10.1364/JOCN.7.000942,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7255260,Elastic optical networks (EONs);Mixed integer linear programming (MILP);Multicast;Reliability with max-min fairness;Virtual network mapping,Reliability;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computer network reliability;Routing;IP networks;Bandwidth;Manganese,9,,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zervas; H. Yuan; A. Saljoghei; Q. Chen; V. Mishra,10,2,A270,A285,"Disaggregated rack-scale data centers have been proposed as the only promising avenue to break the barrier of the fixed CPU-to-memory proportionality caused by main-tray direct-attached conventional/traditional server-centric systems. However, memory disaggregation has stringent network requirements in terms of latency, energy efficiency, bandwidth, and bandwidth density. This paper identifies all the requirements and key performance indicators of a network to disaggregate IT resources while summarizing the progress and importance of optical interconnects. Crucially, it proposes a rack-and-cluster scale architecture, which supports the disaggregation of CPU, memory, storage, and/or accelerator blocks. Optical circuit switching forms the core of this architecture, whereas the end-points (IT resources) are equipped with on-chip programmable hybrid electrical packet/circuit switches. This architecture offers dynamically reconfigurable physical topology to form virtual ones, each embedded with a set of functions. It analyzes the latency overhead of disaggregated DDR4 (parallel) and the proposed hybrid memory cube (serial) memory elements on the conventional and the proposed architecture. A set of resource allocation algorithms are introduced to (1) optimally select disaggregated IT resources with the lowest possible latency, (2) pool them together by means of a virtual network interconnect, and (3) compose virtual disaggregated servers. Simulation findings show up to a 34% resource utilization increase over traditional data centers while highlighting the importance of the placement and locality among compute, memory, and storage resources. In particular, the network-aware locality-based resource allocation algorithm achieves as low as 15 ns, 95 ns, and 315 ns memory transaction round-trip latency on 63%, 22%, and 15% of the allocated virtual machines (VMs) accordingly while utilizing 100% of the CPU resources. Furthermore, a formulation to parameterize and evaluate the additional financial costs endured by disaggregation is reported. It is shown that the more diverse the VM requests are, the higher the net financial gain is.

Most existing studies on NFV dealt with admissions of user requests through deploying Virtualized Network Function (VNF) instances for individual user requests, without considering sharing VNF instances among multiple user requests to provide better network services and improve network throughput. In this paper, we study the network throughput maximization problem by adopting two different VNF instance scalings: (i) horizontal scaling by migrating existing VNF instances from their current locations to new locations; and (ii) vertical scaling by instantiating more VNF instances if needed. Specifically, we first propose a unified framework that jointly considers both vertical and horizontal scalings to maximize the network throughput, by admitting as many requests as possible while meeting their resource demands and end-to-end transmission delay requirements.

To surmount this challenge, service, and resource providers are looking for alternative mechanisms that can successfully facilitate managing network resources in a more dynamic, predictive, and distributed manner. New concepts of network architectures, such as software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), have paved the way to move from static to flexible networks. They make networks more flexible (i.e., network providers capable of on-demand provisioning), easily customizable, and cost effective. In this regard, network slicing is emerging as a new technology built on the concepts of the SDN and NFV. It splits a network infrastructure into isolated virtual networks and allows them to manage resources allocation individually based on their requirements and characteristics. Most of the existing solutions for network slicing are computationally expensive because of the length of time they require to estimate the resources required for each isolated slice. In addition, there is no guarantee that the resource allocation is fairly shared among users in a slice. In this paper, we propose a network slicing resource management (NSRM) mechanism to assign the required resources for each slice in a LTE network, taking into consideration the isolation of resources among different slices. In addition, NSRM aims to ensure isolation and fair sharing of distributed bandwidths between users belonging to the same slice. In NSRM, depending on requirements, each slice can be customized (e.g., each can have a different scheduling policy).",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926446,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753535,LTE network;network slicing;wireless virtualization;wireless resource management,Resource management;Network slicing;Long Term Evolution;Virtualization;Cellular networks;Wireless communication;Quality of service,,42,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we study reliability-aware VNF instances provisioning in an MEC, where different users request different network services with different reliability requirements through paying their requested services with the aim to maximize the network throughput. To this end, we first formulate a novel reliability-aware VNF instance placement problem by provisioning primary and secondary VNF instances at different cloudlets in MEC for each user while meeting the specified reliability requirement of the user request. We then show that the problem is NP-hard and formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we instead devise an approximation algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio for the problem. Moreover, we also consider two special cases of the problem. For one special case where each request only requests one primary and one secondary VNF instances, the problem is still NP-hard, and we devise a constant approximation algorithm for it. For another special case where different VNFs have the same amounts of computing resource demands, we show that it is polynomial-time solvable by developing a dynamic programming solution for it.

In this paper, we study NFV-enabled multicasting in a software-defined network (SDN) with an aim to maximize network throughput while minimizing the implementation cost of admitted NFV-enabled multicast requests, subject to network resource capacity, where the implementation cost of a request consists of its computing resource consumption cost in servers and its network bandwidth consumption cost when routing and processing its data packets in the network. To this end, we first formulate two NFV-enabled multicasting problems with and without resource capacity constraints and one online NFV-enabled multicasting problem. We then devise two approximation algorithms with an approximation ratio of $2M$ for the NFV-enabled multicasting problems with and without resource capacity constraints, if the number of servers for implementing the service chain of each request is no greater than a constant $M$ (≥1). We also study dynamic admissions of NFV-enabled multicast requests without the knowledge of future request arrivals with the objective to maximize the network throughput, for which we propose an efficient heuristic, and for the special case of dynamic request admissions, we devise an online algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$ for it when $M=1$ , where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising and outperform existing heuristics.",10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2881438,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536407,Network function virtualization;software-defined networks;multicasting;NFV-enabled multicasting;service chains;virtualized network functions;routing;approximation;online algorithms,Multicast communication;Multicast algorithms;Servers;Heuristic algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Bandwidth;Software,3,43,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OK,Elastic and Efficient Virtual Network Provisioning for Cloud-Based Multi-tier Applications,2015,2015 44th International Conference on Parallel Processing,M. Shen; K. Xu; F. Li; K. Yang; L. Zhu; L. Guan,,,929,938,"The multi-tier architecture is prevalently adopted by cloud applications, such as the three-tier web application. It is highly desirable for both tenants and providers to provide virtual networks in an efficient and elastic way, where tenant applications can automatically scale in or out with varying workloads and providers can accommodate as many requests as possible in the underlying network. However, due to potential conflicts between efficiency and elasticity, it is challenging to achieve these two goals simultaneously in abstracting tenant requirements and designing corresponding provisioning algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient and elastic virtual network provisioning solution called Easy Alloc, which is comprised of an elasticity-aware abstraction model and a virtual network provisioning algorithm. To accurately capture the tenant requirement and maintain the provisioning simplicity for providers, the elasticity-aware model enables two types of decoupling, i.e., Always-on VMs for normal load and on-demand VMs for dynamic scaling, and the bandwidth requirement of each VM for intra- and inter-tier communications. Then we formulate the virtual network provisioning as an overhead minimization problem, where the objective simultaneously considers the bandwidth and elasticity overhead. Due to the NP-completeness of this problem, we leverage two heuristics, slot reservation and tier iteration, to obtain an efficient algorithm. Extensive simulation results show that compared with a typical elasticity-agnostic method under a heavy load, Easy Alloc enables a 9% increase of request acceptance rate and a 16.8% improvement of the successful extension rate.

OK,Optimizing Network Slice Dimensioning via Resource Pricing,2019,IEEE Access,G. Wang; G. Feng; S. Qin; R. Wen; S. Sun,7,,30331,30343,"Network slicing has been viewed as a key enabler for the next-generation software-defined and cloud-based network (e.g., 5G and beyond) to accommodate diverse services in a flexible and cost-efficient fashion. Network slicing allows a network slice provider (NSP) to operate on a common network infrastructure to create customized isolated logical networks (i.e., network slices) for network slice customers (NSCs), (i.e., service providers). NSP and NSCs are independent operators who pursue profit maximization, while in the literature, only network cost optimization is intensively investigated in terms of service function chain embedding, i.e., virtual network function (VNF) placement and flow routing. Therefore, slices should be dimensioned (i.e., resources allocated to slices) according to the resource availability and the economic mechanism in the network, so as to optimize the resource utilization and improve the profit of NSP/NSCs. In this paper, we study elastic slice dimensioning with resource pricing as a Stackelberg pricing game, in which the NSP sells slices by pricing resources and NSCs adjust their slice's resource demand on VNF capacity and bandwidth, while both are trying to maximize their profit. Then, we formulate optimization problems for the pricing game and find that a closed form solution of the optimal price cannot be obtained for a non-trivial network. Hence, we propose a resource pricing algorithm that aims to maximize the NSP's profit and the network's social welfare. Compared with existing usage-based pricing method and two heuristic methods, our proposed pricing algorithm for slice dimensioning strikes a trade-off between maximizing NSP's profit and other metrics, including the resource utilization. Hence, it will helpfully exploiting the benefits of network slicing.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902432,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8656562,5G;network slicing;profit maximization;slice dimensioning;service function chaining;social welfare,Network slicing;Pricing;Routing;Resource management;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Quality of service,1,49,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oki,PP,99,1,1,"Network function virtualization enables network operators to implement network functions in a software-oriented manner and makes network services (NSes) provisioning much simpler. This paper proposes an optimization model to schedule delay sensitive NSes with deadlines allowing resource sharing and preemption. Unlike conventional NS scheduling models with static resource allocation for virtualized network function (VNF) instances, the proposed model ensures that VNF instances deployed on the same node share computation resources of the node and are able to scale up/down to change their process rate at runtime. NSes mapped to the same VNF instance of the same node share computation resources of the VNF instance and are able to be processed in parallel by the VNF instance. Preemption is allowed, which means that rescheduling the order of NS processing at runtime is possible and the process duration of each function of an NS is allowed to be discrete. We formulate the proposed model as an integer linear programming problem to maximize the number of admissible NSes. Due to the complexity of the problem, we develop a genetic algorithm to solve it efficiently. We evaluate the proposed model with conventional models in the static and dynamic scenarios.

Miyazawa; M. Jibiki; V. P. Kafle; H.

Meanwhile, with the rapid prevalence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications and mobile network services, quality-of-service (QoS) requirements are getting increasingly diverse and network traffic volume and pattern are varying rapidly. The time-varying network traffic requires the infrastructure provider to dynamically adjust the appropriate amount of computational resources (e.g. CPU) assigned to an NF to efficiently process the traffic in the SF chaining infrastructure. In this paper, to adequately allocate CPU resources (available in limited amount) to virtual networks (VNs) requiring to satisfy diverse QoS levels in response to traffic variation without manual operations, we propose autonomic arbitration of CPU resources along SF chains which combines two CPU resource adjustment methods: The first method performs resource arbitration among VNs within a node, and the second method migrates NFs among nodes within a VN. These methods autonomically adjust the amount of CPU resource allocated to each NF so that over utilization of CPU can be avoided as much as possible. Moreover, during the autonomic resource adjustments in SF chains, the proposed methods are able to maintain communication paths on the substrate network so that the service is not interrupted at all. We also propose differentiated resource allocation for QoS differentiation and transferable resource searching.

Deploying NFs requires decisions for both NF placement and routing of flows through these NFs in accordance with the required sequence of NFs that process each flow. The challenge in developing NFV resource allocation schemes is the need to manage the dependency between flow-level (routing) and network-level (placement) decisions. We model the NFV resource allocation problem as a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming problem, solving both flow-level and network-level decisions simultaneously. The optimal solution is capable of providing placement and routing decisions at a small scale.

Wang,,,1,6,"Live migration of virtual network functions (VNF) is a powerful technique with benefits of server maintenance, resource management and dynamic workload re-balance, among others. Downtime and total migration time are mainly two vital indicators to describe the performance of the VNF live migration (VLM). Modern research has effectively reduced the downtime to zero for some specific VNFs (eg. virtual router). However, for general VNFs predominantly leveraging pre-copy approach, such as firewalls, network address translators (NAT), load balancers, etc., there still remain some intractable problems: inevitable service downtime and long migration time on account of large amount of data transferred during migration, both of which result in a severe performance degradation of VNF services. To resolve these issues, we present a solution called PV-QAT to accelerate the migration process for these general VNFs. The PV-QAT creatively exploits the Para-Virtualization (PV) driver to filter out the useless memory pages in the process of migration, and unprecedentedly applies QuickAssist Technology (QAT) to provide fast compression of memory pages with low overhead, The experimental results show that PV-QAT can significantly reduce 77.5% of downtime and 80.5% of total migration time on average when compared with original pre-copy migration of KVM.",10.1109/ICC.2017.7997166,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997166,,Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization;Software;Servers;Network function virtualization;Maintenance engineering,4,30,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is becoming a key enabler and consequently a hot research topic. Dynamic scaling of resources in NFV is a highly important challenge towards its implementation in real-life networks. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the required resources in the appropriate time to sustain true elasticity in NFV. The capacity of different Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) would increase/decrease in a way that the CPU utilization is maximized while the overall cost is minimized. In this paper, we present two strategies to predict the day-ahead CPU utilization. The first strategy is an offline scheduling method that helps managing elasticity in virtualized networks by predicting normal days events. The second one is an online scheduling approach that predicts the day-ahead CPU utilization during sudden peaks due to some unusual circumstances.

The ultimate goal is to satisfy the Cloud's user requirements while maximising Cloud provider's revenue. The problem consists in embedding virtual networks within substrate infrastructure. A new dynamic adaptive virtual network resource allocation strategy named Backtracking-VNE is investigated to deal with the complexity of resource provisioning within Cloud network. The proposal coordinates virtual nodes and virtual links mapping stages to optimise resources usage. Moreover, thanks to forecasting module, Backtracking-VNE guarantees an efficient resources share between embedded virtual links with respect to their occupancy.

The proposal coordinates virtual node and virtual link mapping stages. The main idea behind the proposal is take advantage of unused bandwidth with respect to the occupancy rate of embedded virtual links. Hence, the unused bandwidth will be reassigned to incoming virtual network requests. To do so, Adaptive-VNE adopts the “divide and conquer” strategy. It divides the virtual network request topology into many star topologies. Then, the mapping of each piece within the whole topology is formulated as a K-supplier problem and resolved by an approximation bottleneck algorithm. To generate the global virtual network topology, Adaptive-VNE uses a backtracking algorithm in order to minimise the global mapping cost. Note that the proposal forecasts usage rate of virtual links and adapts their bandwidth reservation. Adaptive-VNE was validated by simulations and compared to the related strategies found in literature. The results obtained show that, contrarily to static bandwidth allocation approaches, the adaptive strategy maximises substrate bandwidth usage while the virtual links' bottleneck rate is minimised. Moreover, the congestion periods are minimised and during the bottleneck the bandwidth satisfaction is maximised.

To utilize the dimension of “space”, including mode-division multiplexing (MDM) using multi-mode (few-mode) fibers and core multiplexing using multi-core fibers, SDM can substantially increase the spectral bandwidth of a fiber-optic communication channel. In SDM optical networks, virtual network mapping becomes very complex, because the resource dimension has increased, meanwhile redundant resources and multi-dimensional resource fragments are more difficult to deal with, which will increase the blocking probability and decrease the utilization of spectrum resources.

Implementing the entire NFs on FPGA is thus resource-demanding. Further, FPGA needs to be reprogrammed when the NF logic changes which can take hours to synthesize the code. It is thus inflexible to use FPGA to implement the entire NFV service chain.

Chou,,,1829,1835,"Network virtualization is a promising technology for the next generation network, which is required to offer a more dynamic and flexible network infrastructure. Virtual network embedding plays a vital role in the resource allocation of network virtualization. Current virtual network embedding allocates resources in an exclusive and excessive manner. For example, the whole bandwidth amount of the virtual network's peak traffic demand is allocated to the virtual network with full availability. However, such excessive resource allocation may result in resource under-utilization, leading to high user cost and low carrier revenue. To address this problem, we propose a new dynamic resource pooling and trading mechanism. The proposed mechanism is formulated as a Stackelberg game, using bandwidth as an example of the resources. We compare the user cost and the carrier revenue under the proposed mechanism against those under the exclusive resource allocation schemes.

Ma,6,,17595,17605,"Network function virtualization (NFV) has become an emerging issue in both academia and industry. By outsourcing network functions from dedicated hardware to virtualization platform, NFV promises to significantly improve the scalability and flexibility of network management and orchestration. One of the main challenges for NFV deployment is to realize coordinated service function chaining on NFV-based infrastructures. This challenge is referred to as the coordinated NFV resource allocation (coordinated NFV-RA) problem which is proved to be NP-hard. In order to response timely to the service variation, many heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms are proposed to reduce the computing complexity. However, it is very difficult to evaluate the approach degree between obtained sub-optimal solutions and the optima, since finding the optimal solution is a non-trivial task. In this paper, a novel modeling approach called homogeneous link mapping is proposed to find the optimal solutions of a typical threestage coordinated NFV-RA model with CPLEX. Then we further establish a service function chain (SFC) deployment database with optimal solutions and the results in the database can be used as a criterion to evaluate other SFC algorithms. In order to imitate different practical networks, the SFC deployments are conducted on three type network topologies. And we also analyze the SFC deploying performance on different topologies.

EC3,Towards efficient server architecture for virtualized network function deployment: Implications and implementations,2016,2016 49th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO),Y. Hu; T. Li,,,1,12,"Recent years have seen a revolution in network infrastructure brought on by the ever-increasing demands for data volume. One promising proposal to emerge from this revolution is Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), which has been widely adopted by service and cloud providers. The essence of NFV is to run network functions as virtualized workloads on commodity Standard High Volume Servers (SHVS), which is the industry standard. However, our experience using NFV when deployed on modern NUMA-based SHVS paints a frustrating picture. Due to the complexity in the NFV data plane and its service function chain feature, modern NFV deployment on SHVS exhibits a unique processing pattern - heterogeneous software pipeline (HSP), in which the NFV traffic flows must be processed by heterogeneous software components sequentially from the NIC to the end re-ceiver. Since the end-to-end performance of flows is cooperatively determined by the performance of each processing stage, the resource allocation/mapping scheme in NUMA-based SHVS must consider a thread-dependence scheduling to tradeoff the impact of co-located contention and remote packet transmission. In this paper, we develop a thread scheduling mechanism that collaboratively places threads of HSP to minimize the end-to-end performance slowdown for NFV traffic flow. It employs a dynamic programming-based method to search for the optimal thread mapping with negligible overhead. To serve this mechanism, we also develop a performance slowdown estimation model to accurately estimate the performance slowdown at each stage of HSP. We implement our collaborative thread scheduling mechanism on a real system and evaluate it using real workloads. On average, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art NUMA-aware and contention-aware scheduling policies by at least 7% on CPU utilization and 23% on traffic throughput with negligible computational overhead (less than 1 second).",10.1109/MICRO.2016.7783711,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783711,NFV;Networking;thread scheduling;NUMA,Pipelines;Software;Handheld computers;Switches;Firewalls (computing);Protocols,11,44,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its traditional implementation is inflexible and high-cost due to relying on proprietary hardware. Emerging technologies such as network function virtualization and software-defined networking are the two promising paradigms for improving the flexibility to implement SFC. A major challenge in this respect is the SFC resource allocation that deals with the efficient allocation of network resources to network functions and their connections belonging to SFC. Previous researches focused on heuristic algorithms for the SFC resource allocation assuming that the topology and the resource requirement of SFC do not change. In this paper, we remove this assumption and study how to adjust resource allocation scheme optimally when SFC changes, which is referred as dynamic SFC resource adjustment problem (DSFC-RAP). It is a challenging problem for various reasons, such as contradiction between reducing resource consumption and minimizing adjustment operation overhead. We first formulate the DSFC-RAP as an integer linear programming. Then, we propose a heuristic-based method to find the near-optimal solution with low computational complexity.

Berthou,,,1,9,"Network virtualization is seen as a key networking paradigm for building diverse network services and architectures over a shared network infrastructure. Assigning network resources to virtual links and, more generally to virtual network topologies, efficiently and on-demand is one of the most challenging components of any network virtualization solution. This paper addresses the problem of on-line resource allocation of multiple virtual links on a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure. The application context that is targeted is primarily the online provisioning of virtual overlay networks even if it can be broadened to address more general virtual networks. Considering an SDN physical infrastructure allows a complete freedom in choosing the optimal physical paths and the associated resources that support the virtual links with no interference from any other network function (such as routing). However, for the time being, forwarding in an SDN network is resource consuming with a noticeable impact on the size of the flow tables. Hence, forwarding (i.e. switching) resources should be carefully considered by the network resource allocation algorithm. This paper proposes a novel Integer-Linear formulation of the above cited problem by taking into account: (1) point-to-point as well as point-to-multipoint virtual links, each with an associated bandwidth requirement and a maximum transfer delay requirement, (2) two types of network resources, namely network links' bandwidth and nodes' switching resources, and (3) optionally, path splitting which allows a virtual link to be established on multiple physical paths. We report preliminary experimental results on a real network topology in an overloaded scenario (bandwidth requests largely exceed network capacity); they show that our algorithm outperforms shortest path heuristics with a gain on the admission rate (of virtual links requests) that ranges from 5 to 15% (compared to the most efficient heuristic) and with a computation time less than a few seconds.",10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145320,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145320,,Bandwidth;Resource management;Delays;Switches;Load modeling;Network topology;Linear programming,11,22,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NFV-based networks are expected to be able to provide carrier-grade services, which require high availability. One of the challenges for achieving high availability is that the commodity servers used in NFV are more error prone than the purpose-built hardware. The “de-facto” technique for fault tolerance is redundancy. However, unless planned carefully, structural dependencies among network nodes could result in correlated node unavailabilities that undermine the effect of redundancy. In this paper, we address the challenge of developing a redundancy resource allocation scheme that takes into account correlated unavailabilities caused by network structural dependencies. The proposed scheme consist of two parts. In the first part, we propose an algorithm to identify nodes that can be highly affected by a node failure because of their network structural dependency with this node. The algorithm analyzes such dependencies using a recently proposed centrality measure called dependency index. In the second part, a redundancy resource allocation scheme that places backup network functions on nodes considering their dependency nature and assigns the instances to flows optimally is proposed. The results show that not considering the network structural dependency in backup placement may significantly affect the service availability to flows.

To share cloud resources efficiently, embedding virtual networks of different users to a distributed cloud consisting of multiple data centers (a substrate network) poses great challenges. Motivated by the fact that most enterprise virtual networks usually operate on long-term basics and have the characteristics of periodic resource demands, in this paper we study the virtual network embedding problem by embedding as many virtual networks as possible to a substrate network such that the revenue of the service provider of the substrate network is maximized, while meeting various Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between enterprise users and the cloud service provider. For this problem, we propose an efficient embedding algorithm by exploring periodic resource demands of virtual networks, and employing a novel embedding metric that models the workloads on both substrate nodes and communication links if the periodic resource demands of virtual networks are given; otherwise, we propose a prediction model to predict the periodic resource demands of these virtual networks based on their historic resource demands.

It brings serious challenges to Network Service Chain (NSC) deployment across multiple domains which are managed by different network operators and service providers. It is difficult for each server in the multi-domain network to obtain a global topology view and available resource information of other domains. Meanwhile, there exist various operational strategies for different network operators and service providers in the multi-domain network. How to optimally deploy NSCs in a multi-domain network to realize cost efficient and low latency service provisioning is challenging. To this end, in this paper, we study the problem of NSC deployment across multiple domains. Specifically, by leveraging Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, we present a novel service deployment framework to deploy Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in the multi-domain network in a cost efficient and low latency method. Then, we establish a multi-objective optimization model with the target of minimizing end-to-end delay, service cost and operational cost with the constraints of resource allocation and VNF dependency relationships. Furthermore, we design a novel heuristic NSC deployment algorithm to solve the optimization model. In the proposed heuristic algorithm, VNF dependency relationship based NSC processing workflow optimization method and Dijkstra algorithm based NSC deployment adjustment method are presented to optimize delay and cost.

Hence scheduling the resource provisioning should be in a manner that all the needed resources will be deployed and active when the load increases. In the same way, it will scale-in the unneeded resources when the traffic load decreases.

Due to a huge amount of underlying network information, the ordinary single domain virtual network mapping program will cause a lot of transmission overhead and computing overhead.

Therefore, based on the resource quotation, a two-step cross-domain embedding strategy of multi-domain virtual network embedding is proposed to dynamically manage the network resources in each autonomous domain. Under the premise of considering the cross-domain network environment and the difference of physical link bandwidth, the cross-domain virtual network embedding is carried out to minimize the cost of virtual network embedding. The first step is to consider node resources and inter-domain bandwidth resources, which is the main overhead for cross-domain embedding. Based on the optimized discrete particle swarm algorithm, the cross-domain virtual network embedding method is proposed to realize the effective mapping. In the second step, a fast algorithm based on Kruskal minimum spanning tree is proposed for intra-domain mapping with relatively small overhead.

The key strategy in network virtualization is of slicing physical resources (links, CPU, memory, and storage) to create virtual networks that are assigned to different operators. One important challenge on network virtualization is the efficient use of the physical resources. To accomplish such efficient use the management of the physical resources should be transparent to the applications running within the virtual networks, and should be executed at runtime in order to deal with the variation on the load requests of different virtual networks. Traditional resource allocation schemes use offline, centralized, and global view strategies to manage the use of physical resources. In contrast to these strategies, we propose a runtime, distributed, local view approach to manage physical resources.

Bagaa,,,1,6,"The existing conventional mobile networks are not flexible: if there is a new service, it unfortunately cannot be integrated automatically. Their traffic routing is not optimal and users' traffic is forwarded to the core network without considering the optimal path. This causes high latency to access the desired service, and the use of resources is inefficient. This has motivated the evolution towards 5G. The 5G vision consists of managing highly dynamic network slices and provisions networks in an as-a-service fashion. In this vein, to answer to the elasticity and low-latency specifications of the upcoming 5G services, the optimal placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) must overcome the non-uniform service demand and the irregular nature of the underlying network topologies. This paper addresses this issue by mapping the non-uniform signaling messages to a new uniform environment, namely, the canonical domain, whereby the placement of core functions is more feasible and efficient. This is carried out by using Schwartz-Christoffel conformal mappings. The conducted experimentation shows the efficiency of our approach, compared to some baseline approaches, in the virtual resource allocation (i.e. Virtual CPU, Virtual DISK) and that is in terms of reducing the overall cost, end-to-end delay and number of activated Virtual Machines (VMs; virtual resources in general).",10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377336,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377336,,Cloud computing;Conformal mapping;Mathematical model;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Quality of experience;Conferences,2,22,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper first proposes a dynamic bandwidth management architecture based on VSDN, and then presents an overall virtual network request scheduling model and finally proposes an optimization algorithm for dynamic bandwidth allocation, namely, K- Shortest Path based on Historical Path Data (HP-KSP). By taking advantage of historical path data and the real-time bandwidth of the physical network links, our HP-KSP algorithm adds a path allocation mechanism to the bandwidth management.

Jaumard; D. Medhi; C. Develder,,,1,8,"Optical networks constitute a fundamental building block that has enabled the success of cloud computing. Virtualization, a cornerstone of cloud computing, today is applied in the networking field: physical network infrastructure is logically partitioned into separate virtual networks, thus providing isolation between distinct virtual network operators (VNOs). Hence, the problem of virtual network mapping has arisen: how to decide which physical resources to allocate for a particular virtual network? In a cloud context, not just network connectivity is required, but also data center (DC) resources located at multiple locations, for computation and/or storage. Given the underlying anycast routing principle, the network operator has some freedom to which specific DC to allocate these resources. In this paper, we solve a resilient virtual network mapping problem that optimally decides on the mapping of both network and multi-location data center resources resiliently using anycast routing, considering time-varying traffic conditions. In terms of resilience, we consider the so-called VNO-resilience scheme, where resilience is provided in the virtual network layer. To minimize physical resource capacity requirements, we allow reuse of both network and DC resources. The failures we protect against include both network and DC resource failures: we hence allocate backup DC resources, and also account for synchronization between primary and backup DC. As optimization criteria, we not only consider resource usage minimization, but also aim to limit virtual network reconfigurations from one time period to the next. We propose a scalable column generation approach to solve the dynamic resilient virtual network mapping problem, and demonstrate it in a case study on a nationwide US backbone network.",10.1109/ICTON.2014.6876287,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876287,Network Virtualization;End-to-End Resilience;Cloud Computing;Anycast Resilience,Synchronization;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Routing;Optical fiber networks;Virtualization;Resilience,5,10,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Huang; Z. Xu; Y. Ma,15,2,732,745,"Data transfer in contemporary networks usually is associated with strict policy enforcement for data transfer security and system performance purposes. Such a policy is represented by a service chain consisting of a sequence of network functions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, transcoders, etc. Due to the high cost and inflexibility of managing hardware-based network functions, network function virtualization (NFV) has emerged as a promising technology to meet the stringent requirement imposed on the service chain of each data transfer request in a low-cost and flexible way. In this paper, we study policy-aware unicast request admissions with and without end-to-end delay constraints in a software defined network. We aim to minimize the operational cost of admitting a single request in terms of both computing resource consumption for implementing the NFVs in the service chain and bandwidth resource consumption for routing its data traffic, or maximize the network throughput for a sequence of requests without the knowledge of future request arrivals. We first formulate four novel optimization problems and provide a generic optimization framework for the problems. We then develop efficient algorithms for the admission of a single NFV-enabled request with and without the end-to-end delay constraint, where NFV-enabled requests are defined as the requests with policy enforcement requirements.

EC4,A Collaborative DDoS Defence Framework Using Network Function Virtualization,2017,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,B. Rashidi; C. Fung; E. Bertino,12,10,2483,2497,"High-profile and often destructive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continue to be one of the top security concerns as the DDoS attacks volumes are increasing constantly. Among them, the SYN Flood attack is the most common type. Conventional DDoS defense solutions may not be preferable, since they demand highly capable hardware resources, which induce high cost and long deployment cycle. The emerging of network function virtualization (NFV) technology introduces new opportunities to decrease the amount of proprietary hardware that is needed to launch and operate network services. In this paper, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism named CoFence, which facilitates a “domain-helps-domain” collaboration network among NFV-based domain networks. CoFence allows domain networks to help each other in handling large volume of DDoS attacks through resource sharing. Specifically, we design a dynamic resource allocation mechanism for domains so that the resource allocation is fair, efficient, and incentive-compatible. The resource sharing mechanism is modeled as a multi-leader-follower Stackelberg game. In this game, all domains have a degree of control to maximize their own utility. The resource supplier domains determine the amount of resource to each requesting peer based on optimizing a reciprocal-based utility function. On the other hand, the resource requesting domains decide the level of demand to send to the resource supplier domains in order to reach sufficient support.

So far, there has been a huge investment from 5G Berlin Innovation Cluster to deliver a unique infrastructure providing opportunities for research centres, SMEs, and start-ups to develop novel solutions and products [1]. In this regard, there has been a complementary activity from Berlin Centre for Digital Transformation to develop a three-node optical network, which connects three Fraunhofer institutes, HHI, FOKUS, and IPK in a metro ring structure [2]. Additionally, there is a recently funded German national project (OTB-5G+) to develop an Open Testbed Berlin for 5G and Beyond, which will deliver a three-node ROADM network. These activities along with some other ones, like the presence of a Berlin node for two of the EU 5G trial projects (i.e., 5Genesis [3] and 5Gvinni [4]), have made Berlin a strategic spot in the evolution of the EU 5G ecosystem. Fraunhofer HHI hosts several aspects of the above-mentioned infrastructure including the 3-node ROADM metro network testbed, which provide a great opportunity to perform real-field experiments with 5G-ready RAN infrastructure and edge compute capability for realizing low-latency end-to-end use-cases. This metro network is SDN controlled and hosts edge compute node capabilities. Additionally, it could offer NFV services and will eventually support network slicing. Regarding the RAN infrastructure, currently, there are LTE base stations installed, which operate at 2.6 GHz. They will be upgraded to 5G base stations operating at 3.7 GHz as soon as they become available. The access segment, which is based on a passive WDM network, is expected to be extended by sophisticated mm-wave and optical-wireless communication links as bridges demonstrating the network extensions where optical fibers cannot be deployed. This network will be an SDN-enabled allowing the inclusion of several street 5G access points to the infrastructure. The three-node ROADM test-bed described above and shown in Fig. 1 will also host several demonstrations, including the final demonstration of metro-haul project [5].

We propose ESFC, a user space service chain management framework to reallocate computing resource of each NF components dynamically based on real-time statistics, while minimizing performance overhead. The ESFC framework monitors load on a service chain at high frequency (1000Hz) and employs proactive resource allocation policy to enable elastic scaling. ESFC utilizes an asynchronous mechanism to notify the to-be-scaled NF, which will be reallocated with computing resources via thread. Moreover, ESFC adopts a perfect distribution algorithm to reduce cache invalidation and state migration while scaling, which are crucial to performance. The results show that ESFC could adjust the devoted resources dynamically and achieve up to 3x higher cost-effectiveness without compromising performance.

To best utilize Cloud resources for profit making, Cloud providers rely on intelligent resource allocation algorithms when provisioning the virtualized environments for tenant service hosting. Conventional resource allocation proposals mainly focus on efficient allocation of the computing and storage resources, with little effort on ensuring the network performance of tenant services. To address this issue, a number of recent efforts abstract tenant services in the form of virtual infrastructures for resource allocation. A virtual infrastructure specifies the tenant's demand of both the computing resources for hosting virtual servers, and the network bandwidth for inter-virtual server communications. With the problem of resource allocation for virtual infrastructures being NP-hard in general networks, heuristic algorithms have been proposed for this problem.

Timm-Giel,,,3487,3492,"Network Virtualization (NV) offers an efficient usage of resource by sharing the infrastructure with different virtual network operators while deploying new services. However, it also raises new challenges for network operators and researchers [1]. One of the main challenges is the efficient resource allocation, known as virtual network (VN) mapping problem. In a dynamic scenario, where VN requests come and leave dynamically, the ability to reallocate the currently-mapped networks allows to enhance the resource utilization. But it also leads to the service disruption of reconfigured virtual networks. In this paper, we study the problem of virtual network reconfiguration taking into account the cost incurred by the disrupted services. Most of the recent research on this topic just focused on the acceptance ratio of the virtual networks but didn't address the possible service disruption during the reconfiguration. This paper proposes a reconfiguration mechanism, which is triggered whenever a new coming virtual network request cannot be mapped on the current network. The mechanism re-allocates the currently-mapped networks to accommodate the new request, provided that the minimized cost of reconfiguration doesn't not exceed the gain from mapping the new request. The approach is mathematically formulated as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that maximizes the net gain of the reconfiguration.

Software defined networking (SDN) solutions can be used to support SFC to reduce both the management complexity and the operational costs. One of the most critical issues for the service and network providers is the reduction of energy consumption, which should be achieved without impacting the Quality of Service. In this paper, we propose a novel resource allocation architecture which enables energy-aware SFC for SDN-based networks, considering also constraints on delay, link utilization, server utilization. To this end, we formulate the problems of VNF placement, allocation of VNFs to flows, and flow routing as integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problems. Since the formulated problems cannot be solved (using ILP solvers) in acceptable timescales for realistic problem dimensions, we design a set of heuristic to find near-optimal solutions in timescales suitable for practical applications. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms over a real-world topology under various network traffic patterns. Our results confirm that the proposed heuristic algorithms provide near-optimal solutions (at most 14% optimality-gap) while their execution time makes them usable for real-life networks.",10.1109/TNSM.2018.2873225,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8480442,Software defined network (SDN);service function chaining (SFC);energy consumption;VNF placement,Resource management;Energy consumption;Optimization;Routing;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Delays,5,43,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pavlou,15,1,475,488,"Mobile edge-cloud (MEC) aims to support low latency mobile services by bringing remote cloud services nearer to mobile users. However, in order to deal with dynamic workloads, MEC is deployed in a large number of fixed-location micro-clouds, leading to resource wastage during stable/low workload periods. Limiting the number of micro-clouds improves resource utilization and saves operational costs, but faces service performance degradations due to insufficient physical capacity during peak time from nearby micro-clouds. To efficiently support services with low latency requirement under varying workload conditions, we adopt the emerging network function virtualization (NFV)-enabled MEC, which offers new flexibility in hosting MEC services in any virtualized network node, e.g., access points, routers, etc. This flexibility overcomes the limitations imposed by fixed-location solutions, providing new freedom in terms of MEC service-hosting locations. In this paper, we address the questions on where and when to allocate resources as well as how many resources to be allocated among NFV-enabled MECs, such that both the low latency requirements of mobile services and MEC cost efficiency are achieved. We propose a dynamic resource allocation framework that consists of a fast heuristic-based incremental allocation mechanism that dynamically performs resource allocation and a reoptimization algorithm that periodically adjusts allocation to maintain a near-optimal MEC operational cost over time. We show through extensive simulations that our flexible framework always manages to allocate sufficient resources in time to guarantee continuous satisfaction of applications' low latency requirements.

Currently telecommunication carriers are re-architecting their central offices as NFV datacenters that, along with SDN, help network service providers to speed deployment and reduce cost. However, it is still unclear how a carrier network shall organize its NFV datacenter resources into a coherent service architecture to support global network functional demands. This work proposes a hierarchical NFV/SDN-integrated architecture in which datacenters are organized into a multi-tree overlay network to collaboratively process user traffic flows. The proposed architecture steers traffic to a nearby datacenter to optimize user-perceived service response time. Our experimental results reveal that the 3-tier architecture is favored over others as it strikes a good balance between centralized processing and edge computing, and the resource allocation should be decided based on traffic's source-destination attributes.

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has been seen a promising solution in order to enable elasticity in the cellular core. Applying NFV to the EPC raises the need for network function (NF) placement, which in turn entails significant challenges, due to the stringent delay budgets among cellular core components and the coexistence of communicating data and control plane elements. To address these challenges, we present a linear programming (LP) formulation for the computation of NF placements that strikes a balance between optimality and time complexity.

However, the advantages of flexibility, scalability and low cost of commodity hardware come at a price, such as resource over-provisioning, because the performance of softwarized network functions on shared resources is hardly predictable. This paper addresses the problem of performance prediction for multi-core software routers. Specifically, the performance prediction model is developed to predict the maximum throughput a multi-core software router can perform given assigned resources. Motivated by observations, we first mathematically analyze how many CPU cycles spent for packet forwarding in multi-core processing systems. Our analytical model based on cache contention can capture its nonlinear dilation scaled by the number of CPU cores-called dilated CPU consumption (DCC). We validate the accuracy of DCC with measured data, achieving error less than 8%. We then propose two performance prediction algorithms based on the DCC. The first algorithm relies on CPU utilization statistics (called DCC-u), while its simplified version (called sDCC) does not require CPU utilization statistics. Evaluation with measured data shows that the estimations of DCC-u has error margins less than 3% for a large packet size and 10% for a small packet size, while sDCC provides larger error than DCC-u.

Several virtual network abstractions have been proposed for the tenants to specify and reserve their virtual clusters with bandwidth guarantee. However, they require pre-determined fixed cluster size and bandwidth, and do not support the scaling of the cluster in size and bandwidth requirements. On the other hand, the existing works on virtual cluster scaling focus on dynamically adjusting the cluster size without considering any bandwidth guarantee targeted by current network abstractions. To fill the gap, this paper considers the problem of scaling up a virtual network abstraction with bandwidth guarantee. Efficient algorithms are proposed to find the valid allocation for the scaled cluster abstraction with optimization on the VM locality of the cluster.

However, GPU-accelerated NFV systems suffer from significant latency variation when multiple network functions (NFs) are co-located in the same machine, which prevents operators from supporting latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Existing research efforts to address this problem can only guarantee a limited number of SLOs with very low resource utilization efficiency. In this paper, we present the Grus framework to support latency SLOs in GPU-accelerated NFV systems. Grus thoroughly analyzes the sources of latency variation and proposes three design principles: (1) dynamic batch size setting is needed to bound packet batching latency in CPU; (2) a reordering mechanism for data transfer over PCI-E is required to guarantee the stalling time; and (3) maximizing concurrency in GPU is necessary to avoid NF execution waiting time. Guided by the principles, Grus consists of two logical layers including an infrastructure layer and a scheduling layer. The infrastructure layer is equipped with an in-CPU Reorder-able Worker Pool that could adjust batching size and packet transfer order, and in-GPU Controllable Concurrent Executors to provide maximized concurrency. The scheduling layer runs a heuristic algorithm to perform accurate and fast scheduling to guarantee SLOs based on our prediction models. We have implemented a prototype of Grus.

The importance of a joint optimization of both network and IT domains is emphasized, a new paradigm triggered by SDN/NFV technologies. We discuss the theoretical limits to algorithm performances, and review available open-source frameworks for problem modeling that enable the interaction with solvers. Finally, we focus on the Net2Plan open-source network planning tool, a Java-based software that suitably embraces the multiple features required in the optimization of joint transport network and IT resource SDN/NFV ecosystems. Recent works based on Net2Plan are reviewed to illustrate its suitability for rapid algorithm prototyping, and for interaction with SDN/NFV-enabled networks.",10.1109/JLT.2018.2869242,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8458186,Network function virtualization;open source software;optimization;software defined networking;transport networks,Optimization;Open source software;Open systems;Optical fiber networks;Network function virtualization;Software algorithms,1,108,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC4,Designing Security-Aware Service Requests for NFV-Enabled Networks,2019,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),H. Jmila; G. Blanc,,,1,9,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a recent concept where virtualization enables the shift from network functions (e.g., routers, switches, load-balancers, proxies) on specialized hardware appliances to software images running on all-purpose, high-volume servers. The resource allocation problem in the NFV environment has received considerable attention in the past years. However, little attention was paid to the security aspects of the problem in spite of the increasing number of vulnerabilities faced by cloud-based applications. Securing the services is an urgent need to completely benefit from the advantages offered by NFV. In this paper, we show how a network service request, composed of a set of service function chains (SFC) should be modified and enriched to take into consideration the security requirements of the supported service. We examine the well-known security best practices and propose a two-step algorithm that extends the initial SFC requests to a more complex chaining model that includes the security requirements of the service.",10.1109/ICCCN.2019.8847058,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8847058,,Security;Resource management;Substrates;Bandwidth;Hardware;Virtualization;Best practices,,21,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC4,Computation Offloading Optimization Based on Probabilistic SFC for Mobile Online Gaming in Heterogeneous Network,2019,IEEE Access,H. Jin; X. Zhu; C. Zhao,7,,52168,52180,"To support new services targeted by 5G, great efforts have been taken not only on the research work of new waveform design and air interface but also on cloudification and softwarization for future heterogeneous network. As one of the most popular services toward 5G, cloud gaming offloads computation-intensive tasks to the cloud in order to alleviate the computation burden of mobile devices, but it introduces latency which deteriorates user experience especially for the delay-sensitive online game. In order to solve the optimization problem of resource allocation with the quality of experience guarantees and reduce the operational expenditures and capital expenditures of mobile operators for deploying online game, fog computing and network function virtualization are deemed as promising solutions. In this paper, a component-based approach is proposed to model online game based on the probabilistic service function chain. In order to obtain the optimal virtual function placement in the fog-enabled heterogeneous radio access network, the cost minimization of computation offloading on the data plane is formulated as an integer linear programming problem considering the constraints of application maximum tolerable latency, resource limitation, and user behavior. The optimization problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem with low complexity, the heuristic algorithm is proposed called Probabilistic Service function chain Embedding based on Cost Optimization(PSECO). The performances of the two algorithms are evaluated. The simulation results show that the costs are affected mainly by the number of components, the arrival rate of user requests, mobile user behavior, as well as the physical network topology and the number of users. The heuristic algorithm PSECO has optimal results with low complexity and it is suitable for large scale networks.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909971,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8689359,Computation offloading;fog computing;network function virtualization;online game;resource allocation;service function chain,Computational modeling;Optimization;Edge computing;Probabilistic logic;Servers;Cloud gaming,1,40,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selection of the correct data is very important as it decides to auto-scale the resources. In cloud & SDN environments such as NFV, auto-scaling becomes more critical in terms of precision and accuracy. In our case, we propose a solution for auto-scaling the network resources based on the calculations made for every action's execution-time [1] of respective instances of a VNF. The instances for each VNF are auto-scaled on the basis of execution-times per time slot, and the number of cores that are assigned by the usage of weight factor [2] used for virtual/physical cores.

Taleb,,,1,7,"The network softwarization paradigm, enabled by Network Function Virtualization (NFV), facilitates the automation of management operations and orchestration of future networks, thus reducing their operational expenditures. The envisioned management practices include the introduction of automation in the scaling of network services. This may enable operators to handle workload fluctuations, to keep the desired performance, with great agility and reduced costs. This procedure introduces a non-negligible delay in allocating or releasing virtual resources. Therefore, waiting until the system is overloaded or underutilized so as to scale resources up or down could negatively impact the users' Quality of Experience, or lead to inefficient resource utilization. In this vein, this paper proposes a novel and agile Dynamic Auto Scaling Algorithm for the Control Plane (CP) of the Long Term Evolution' (LTE) virtualized Evolved Packet Core (vEPC). The resources dimensioning stage of the algorithm is based on an original queuing model for the CP. To model the CP, we use an open network of G/G/m queues.

EC4,Congestion Games With Player-Specific Utility Functions and Its Application to NFV Networks,2019,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,S. Le; Y. Wu; X. Sun,16,4,1870,1881,"In this paper, a variation of the congestion situation is considered and a new game, the congestion game with player-specific (CGPS) utility functions, is proposed. This paper is motivated by some application scenarios that rule out the possibility of employing the existing game model to study such congestion situations. The CGPS game is characterized by adding a player-specific term and a weighted parameter with respect to the utility function. By using the semitensor product of matrices, the algebraic representation of the CGPS game is given and the existence of the weighted potential function is proved. Finally, the results are applied to solve the service chain composition problem in network function virtualization (NFV) and to analyze the effect of player-specific function on service chain configuration in NFV. Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by resource allocation problems in congestion networks where strategic users behave selfishly and aim at optimizing their own individual utility in the absence of a central controller. Compared with the centralized algorithms of poor reliability and scalability, game-theoretic control provides a promising distributed approach for resource allocation. In the game-theoretic framework, the existence and seeking of the desired solution are important issues. In this paper, a novel model is established to extend the utility functions space guaranteeing the existence of the solution. The developed utility design is used to capture users' different sensitivities to the effects of the network system. Simultaneously, it is more meaningful from the view of engineering to design the utility functions so that the desirable behavior is reachable. We also give an explicit scheme to seek the desired solution. The proposed model is finally applied to the service chain composition problem in NFV, of which the aim is to find the best service chain of users that accommodates their individual requirements.

Implementing network coding in the core Internet is subject to practical concerns, since Internet routers are often overwhelmed by packet forwarding tasks, leaving little processing capacity for coding operations. Inspired by the recent paradigm of network function virtualization, we propose implementing network coding as a new network function, and deploying such coding functions in geo-distributed cloud data centers, to practically enable network coding on the Internet. We target multicast sessions (including unicast flows as special cases), strategically deploy relay nodes (network coding functions) in selected data centers between senders and receivers, and embrace high bandwidth efficiency brought by network coding with dynamic coding function deployment. We design and implement the network coding function on typical virtual machines, featuring efficient packet processing.

Recently, in contrast to conventional fixed cloud locations, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) has, with some added cost due to the necessary decentralization, enhanced MEC with new flexibility in placing MEC services to any nodes capable of virtualizing their resources. In this work, we address the question on how to optimally place resources among NFV-enabled nodes to support mobile multimedia applications with low latency requirement and when to adapt the current resource placements to address workload changes. We first show that the placement optimization problem is NP-hard and propose an online dynamic resource allocation scheme that consists of an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm and a detection mechanism to identify the time when the system will no longer be able to satisfy the applications' delay requirement. Our scheme takes into account the effect of current existing techniques (i.e., auto-scaling and load balancing).

When a function fails, one of the corresponding servers providing protection is required to recover it, if the function is protected by any server. We aim to find an assignment of servers to functions where the unavailability of the function that is in the worst case is minimized. We formulate the backup resource allocation problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem. We prove that the backup resource allocation problem is NP-complete by showing that the partition problem is reducible to it. A heuristic algorithm is introduced to solve the same optimization problem. We analyze the computational time complexity of the heuristic algorithm as a polynomial. We show the comparison results obtained by the heuristic algorithm and by solving the mixed integer linear programming problem in terms of deviation and computational time.

However, the differences between optical and wireless subnetworks pose severe obstacle on their interoperability of resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the survivable virtual network embedding (SVNE) in the FiWi access network for the purpose of the robust IoT service provisioning even in the scenario of network component failure. Each type of the IoT service is carried on one virtual network (VN), which is characterized by not only computing the resource and bandwidth resource demands but also the connection availability requirement. A connection availability model is proposed as an indicator of the network survivability and the IoT service robustness. We aim to allocate the resource for each VN with the resource cost minimized.

Wosinska,,,1,4,"Cloud computing is increasingly based on geographically distributed data centers interconnected by high performance networks. Application of Software Defined Networking (SDN) is studied as an emerging solution to support dynamic network resource management for distributed data centers (DCs) jointly with extensive use of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). SDN/NFV operation takes advantage of orchestration of network control functions according to distributed DCs communication needs. Orchestration relies on a set of logical information related to the underlying infrastructure, called abstraction, which offers different levels of visibility of available resources, depending on the abstraction strategy adopted. Different abstraction strategies have been proposed in recent literature with the purpose of achieving flexible and scalable solutions for SDN/NFV operation. However, their specific application to distributed DC interconnection has not been thoroughly investigated yet. One of the critical aspects of abstraction in distributed DC operation is the amount of information provided to the orchestrator, which influences both connection request blocking probability and the rate at which orchestrator needs to update its information data base. In this paper, abstraction strategies for distributed DC networks are considered and extended with respect to previous works. Their performance are evaluated in terms of connection blocking probability and orchestrator update rate. The simulation results show that different abstraction strategies lead to different trade-offs between blocking performance and update rate. In particular, the solution based on weighted virtual links is shown to represent a flexible approach open to further possible improvement by considering different performance indicators.",10.1109/ICTON.2017.8025184,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8025184,Data Center;Optical networks;SDN;Orchestration;Abstraction;Simulation,Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Integrated optics;Computer architecture;Complexity theory;Optical wavelength conversion,,9,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC1,Hierarchical Creation of Virtual Networks,2006,2006 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium NOMS 2006,M. El-Darieby; J. Rolia,,,220,229,This paper describes a scalable and hierarchical virtual network creation (HVNC) protocol. The protocol encapsulates network control operations such as signaling and routing. It relies on a hierarchical organization of network resources and their managers. The network hierarchy of HVNC provides network-wide views of network resource status. This enables network-wide decisions such as balancing traffic loads among network domains and traffic isolation in accordance to policies. HVNC enables flexible and dynamic virtual network management including reconfiguration and failure recovery. These advantages come at the cost of higher setup and information storage costs when compared to standard service creation protocols. We characterize the advantages and costs of HVNC by simulation. The relatively high costs of HVNC make it more suitable to create long-lived high-bandwidth virtual networks. This type of virtual networks supports emerging technologies and applications such as grid and peer-to-peer computing and data-intensive e-science applications,10.1109/NOMS.2006.1687553,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687553,Network Service Provisioning;Scalability;overlay networks;Hierarchical Networks;VPN,Quality of service;Protocols;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Costs;Computer networks;Transportation;Scalability;Routing;Communication system traffic control,3,22,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC4,Packet cache network function for peer-to-peer traffic management with Bloom-filter based flow classification,2016,2016 18th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS),K. Sasaki; A. Nakao,,,1,6,"Following the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, millions of computer users have used P2P systems to search for desired content. P2P traffic is known to be highly redundant because of its inherent self-scaling characteristics, which means that file sharing is performed more efficiently when more users exchange the same content. To remove redundant P2P traffic, we have proposed a method to control the P2P traffic through a packet-level data cache that acts as a network function at the edge of the Internet service provider (ISP) networks [1]. However, our previous method involves high levels of memory consumption. Software-defined networking (SON) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are representative trends in network soft-warization that may lower the barrier to deployment of network management functions that are considered to be useful but are difficult to actually implement and deploy. In this paper, we propose a new flow classification for P2P that uses a queue Bloom filter (QBF) to reduce the memory consumption of the P2P cache. The QBF is a time series queue that manages Bloom filters and it can remove inserted Bloom filter elements without generating false positives. If the router can confirm that P2P flows are carrying duplicate contents using QBF, it then begins to cache the duplicate content. Our analysis shows that the proposed method reduces memory consumption to 67% and improves the P2P cache hit ratio by 4% when compared with the previous approach, while its performance in removing redundancy from the P2P traffic is degraded by only 14% . In addition, we discuss the implementation and deployment of the proposed system at the edge routers of ISP networks by applying SON and NFV.",10.1109/APNOMS.2016.7737214,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737214,P2P;Overlay Network;Cache System;Bloom filter;SDN;NFV,Market research;Memory management;Internet;Redundancy;Image edge detection;Maintenance engineering;Peer-to-peer computing,2,20,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and VM-placement, a problem that only recently received attention in all-electrical datacenter networks, poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenters. In particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the switch size, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance. We abstract the requests of tenants as virtual networks, and study the problem of embedding virtual networks on a hybrid datacenter, which translates to the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and placement such that the topology constraints of virtual networks are satisfied. We develop and analyse two algorithms for embedding dynamically arriving virtual network demands on a hybrid optical-electrical datacenter.

First, it provides a flexible virtual network migration primitive, as it deploys a Software Defined Networking between virtual machines, based on OpenFlow. Second, it provides a strong isolation of virtual networks, avoiding denial of service caused by interference of other virtual networks. Third, XenFlow offers inter-network and intra-network QoS provisioning by a consistent resource controller. We developed a prototype and our results show that the proposed system performs better than native mechanism of Xen virtual machine migration. XenFlow allows virtual router migration between different local area networks without creating tunnels or losing packets.

In this paper, we propose a regression analysis model utilizing a sparse modeling to predict the average server load in a future specific time period on the basis of the server load in a past specific time period. We target at the number of access to a Web server as a virtual server load. The model can reduce the prediction error compared to a traditional least square method. Besides, we propose two methods to further reduce prediction errors: (A) an algorithm for determining the time period targeted for explanatory variables, and (B) two-stage regression analyses. As a result of MATLAB calculations, we show that application of the sparse modeling can reduce the prediction error by more than 40%, and besides, the above two proposed methods are effective at further reducing the prediction error with a few minutes' learning time.

Kawabata; F. He; E. Oki,,,1,6,"The performance of packet processing applications is dependent on memory accesses speed of network systems. Table lookup requires fast memory accesses and is one of the most common processes in various packet processing applications, which can be a dominant performance bottleneck. Therefore, in Network Function Virtualization (NFV)-aware environment, on-chip fast cache memories of a CPU of general-purpose hardware become critical to achieve high performance packet processing over tens of Gbps. In addition, multiple types of applications and complex applications are executed in the same system simultaneously in carrier network systems, which require the capacity of cache memories as well. In this paper, we propose a packet processing architecture that utilizes interleaved 3 Dimensional (3D)-stacked Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) devices as off-chip Last Level Cache (LLC) in addition to several levels of dedicated cache memories of each CPU core. Entries of a lookup table are distributed in every bank and vaults to utilize both bank interleaving and vault-level memory access parallelism. Frequently accessed entries in 3D-stacked DRAM are also cached in dedicated on-chip cache memories of each CPU core. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture reduces the memory access latency by 57 % and increases the throughput by 100 % with reducing blocking probability about 10 % compared to the conventional architecture with common on-chip LLC.

Tian,,,853,858,"Network virtualization plays an important role in the development of the network because of its dynamics and flexibility on network infrastructure configuration. Virtual network mapping is the main method to realize the network virtualization. Most of the current virtual network mappings always allocate network resources in an exclusive and excessive way. For example, the entire bandwidth amount of the virtual network will be allocated according to its peak demand of the traffic. However, the truth is that the actual traffic needs of virtual network are changing constantly throughout its lifetime, and the distribution of static mapping will inevitably lead to the underutilization of the assigned resource, high user cost as well as low carrier revenue. In order to solve the above problems, we need to predict the changes of virtual network's demands accurately and adjust the allocation of resources dynamically. In this paper, we propose a virtual network mapping method based on support vector machine (SVM) to dynamically allocate and adjust the network resources.

An effective approach for improving the latency and throughput performance is to exploit new network function (NF) processing framework on general purpose processors.

In TNP, we jointly organize the parallelization of multiple NFs at the service tier and perform multicore mapping of individual NFs at the substrate network tier. We formulate the optimal TNP design problem as minimizing link bandwidth consumption subject to end-to-end latency and computing resource constraints. We solve the problem by decomposing it into two easier subproblems: 1) subproblem 1 (SP1) is to solve the optimal SFC parallelization graph design in conjunction with link mapping problem and 2) subproblem 2 (SP2) is to jointly solve computing resource allocation in conjunction with node mapping problem. The global optimal solution is accomplished by searching in a set of feasible regions in sequence.

An infrastructure provider that hosts the application decides how to map the virtual network to the substrate network. Different from the VDC abstraction, each virtual node in our proposed abstraction can be split and mapped onto multiple physical machines, which allows the infrastructure provider to provide auto scaling for the application with variable number of physical machines for exploring the full benefits of parallel computing. We also allow multiple virtual nodes to be mapped and colocated in the same physical machine to minimize resource fragmentation and communication overhead.

One of its important challenges of this technology is how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to multiple virtual network users. To overcome these challenges, we develop the game- theory based schemes to resolve the resources allocation problem on both buffer/storage space and transmission-rate. Mapping the virtual networks onto the physical wireless network is formulated as the process of bidding for the limited wireless resources from a physical substrate wireless network, and competing with the other mobile-user players, which bid for the same wireless resources of a physical substrate wireless network. Our proposed game- theory schemes work as follows. First, virtual network announces its value function to the physical substrate wireless network, to claim for their required resources (buffer/storage space and transmission bandwidth). Then, the physical substrate wireless network allocates the two types of wireless resources to each virtual wireless network and charges for the provided resources according to the claimed value functions for all virtual users and its current network conditions. Finally our proposed schemes feed back conjectural prices for virtual networks' next-time bid. By accepting the conjectural prices, the game of virtual networks converges the Nash Equilibrium where their long term payoffs are optimized.

Lu,,,1,8,"Virtual networks that allow tenants to explicitly specify their computing as well as networking resources are recently proposed to be better interfaces between cloud providers and tenants. Many virtual networks have time-varying resource demands, as evidenced in prior studies [1-3]. New opportunities emerge when such variation is exploited. In this paper, we design a novel resource demand model for tenants to flexibly trade off between application performance and cost, and propose a work-conserving allocation algorithm, WCA, for deploying virtual networks with time-varying resource demands.

In this paper, by jointly considering cache space and time-frequency resource allocation in wireless virtualized networks, we first formulate an optimization programming to investigate the minimization problem of network overheads while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirements of each virtual network on overflow probability. Then, with diverse demands of virtual networks for different kinds of resources taken into consideration, an online adaptive virtual resource allocation algorithm with multiple time-scales based on auto regressive moving average (ARMA) prediction method is proposed to solve the formulation, which could eliminate the irrationalities existed in traditional approaches caused by the uncertainty of traffic and information feedback delay. More specifically, in the proposed resource scheduling mechanism with multiple time-scales, on the one hand, a reservation strategy of cache space is developed according to the ARMA prediction information under long time-scales. On the other hand, virtual networks are sorted by the overflow probabilities derived by the large-deviation principle and dynamic time-frequency resource scheduling under short time-scales.

EC1,Optimal mapping of virtual networks considering reactive reconfiguration,2012,2012 IEEE 1st International Conference on Cloud Networking (CLOUDNET),Phuong Nga Tran; L. Casucci; A. Timm-Giel,,,35,40,"Network Virtualization (NV) has recently been considered as a key feature of the Future Internet because it allows easy transition from existing IPv4 based Internet to new mechanisms and protocols, and a more efficient usage of infrastructure by sharing it with different virtual network operators while deploying new services. However, Network Virtualization also raises new challenges for network operators [1]. One of the main challenges is the efficient resource allocation, known as virtual network mapping problem, in which virtual nodes and links are embedded to specific substrate nodes and paths. In this paper, we study this problem for the online scenario, where virtual network requests come and leave dynamically while considering the ability to reconfigure (re-arrange) the currently mapped virtual networks. All the recent research on this topic just focuses on the acceptance ratio of the virtual networks but do not address the possible service disruption during the reconfiguration. This paper proposes a so-called reactive reconfiguration mechanism, which reacts to any rejection of new coming virtual network requests. If a virtual network is rejected due to the lack of physical resources, the mechanism is triggered to reconfigure the currently-mapped networks so that the new request can be embedded. At the same time, it minimizes the number of necessary changes to reduce the service disruption. The mechanism is mathematically formulated as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and solved by CPLEX [2]. Its performance is then evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with the case of no reconfiguration. A heuristic is then proposed to speed up the solving time of the ILP problem while maintaining its performance.",10.1109/CloudNet.2012.6483651,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483651,Network Virtualization;virtual network mapping;network reconfiguration;ILP,Substrates;Bandwidth;Indexes;Resource management;Equations;Internet;Conferences,6,14,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EC1,Exploring virtual network selection algorithms in DSM cache coherence protocols,2004,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,M. Chaudhuri; M. Heinrich,15,8,699,712,"Distributed shared memory (DSM) multiprocessors typically require disjoint networks for deadlock-free execution of cache coherence protocols. This is normally achieved by implementing virtual networks with the help of virtual channels or virtual lanes multiplexed on a single physical network. To keep the coherence protocol simple, messages are usually assigned to virtual lanes in a predefined static manner based on a cycle-free lane assignment dependence graph. However, this static split of virtual networks (such as request and reply networks) may lead to underutilization of certain virtual networks while saturating the other networks. In this paper, we explore different static and dynamic schemes to select the virtual lanes for outgoing messages and mix the load among them without restricting any particular type of message to be carried only by a particular virtual network. We achieve this by exposing the selection algorithms to the coherence protocol itself, so that it can inject messages into selected virtual lanes based on some local information, and still enjoy deadlock-freedom. Our execution-driven simulation on five applications from the SPLASH-2 suite shows that as the system scales, the virtual network selection algorithms play an important role. For 128-node systems, our dynamic selection algorithm speeds up parallel execution by as much as 22 percent over an optimized baseline system running a modified SGI Origin 2000 protocol. We also explore how network latency, the number of message buffers per virtual lane, and the depth of network interface output queues affect the relative performance of various virtual lane selection algorithms.",10.1109/TPDS.2004.35,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333640,Distributed shared memory;cache coherence protocol;virtual network;deadlock-freedom.,Intelligent networks;System recovery;Network interfaces;Heuristic algorithms;Delay;Inspection;Routing protocols,4,26,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embedding virtual networks in data centers to allocate cloud resources to the applications running on the virtual machines is crucial since it affects resource efficiency and thus the revenue of cloud providers. Most of the existing embedding algorithms consider allocation of virtual machines and bandwidth as two sub-problems of the virtual network embedding problem and solve them separately. The performance drastically degrades when applying these algorithms to optical data centers due to the wavelength continuity constraint and high degree of the optical switch. In this paper, we propose a Markov Chain-based algorithm for virtual network embedding in optical data centers (MCA-VNE). We develop a Markov chain model to compute the ranking of a Top-of-the-Rack (ToR) based on not only its resource capacities but also that of its direct neighbors. The Markov model takes into account three resource parameters of a ToR: the computing capacity, the available bandwidth on the established lightpaths from itself to other ToRs and the possible bandwidth that can be provided in future based on the number of wavelengths currently available. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through comprehensive simulations.

However, energy efficiency and the resulting complexity of network/service management pose serious sustainability and scalability issues that may hinder NFV's advantages. This paper considers these aspects in the context of datacenter networks. We propose an energy-aware resource allocation scheme to manage virtual machines, dedicated to perform certain (virtualized) network functions, among a pool of energy-tunable physical resources (processors/cores). We use online measurements to periodically estimate some statistical features of the offered workloads by considering a fairly general renewal model that captures traffic bustiness and hardware operational settings. Then, resources are dynamically managed by jointly performing power scaling and in-server consolidation according to the actual workload variations. The average power consumption generated by this strategy is evaluated and compared with that of a classical bin-packing consolidation, over processors running always with the highest-performance configuration. Results show that the proposed approach can reduce the average power consumption of the datacenter by up to 10%, suggesting a considerable amount of annual savings.",10.1109/CloudNet.2016.20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776578,NFV;consolidation;energy efficiency,Servers;Power demand;Performance evaluation;Mathematical model;Indexes;Program processors;Multicore processing,2,20,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroNF addresses the performance overhead and resource efficiency problems in three ways. First, MicroNF graph constructor reuses the processing results of elements from different NFs and reconstructs the MSFC after modularization to shorten the chain latency. Second, optimized placer pays attention to the problem of which elements to consolidate and provides a performance-aware placement algorithm to place MSFCs compactly and optimize the global packet transfer cost. Third, MicroNF individual scaler innovatively introduces a push-aside scaling up strategy to avoid degrading performance and taking up new CPU cores. To support MSFC reusing and consolidation, MicroNF also designs a high-performance infrastructure to efficiently forwarding packets with consistency ensured and to automatically scheduling elements with fairness ensured when the elements are consolidated on the CPU core.

Despite these benefits, a major challenge cloud providers are still facing is how to efficiently allocate resources for NFV-based services in a way that reduces operational costs and maximizes their profits. In this paper, we address this particular challenge and propose an effective profit-driven service chain provisioning scheme designed for large-scale infrastructures spanning different geographically-distributed sites.

EC2,Heuristic Approaches to the Controller Placement Problem in Large Scale SDN Networks,2015,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,S. Lange; S. Gebert; T. Zinner; P. Tran-Gia; D. Hock; M. Jarschel; M. Hoffmann,12,1,4,17,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) marks a paradigm shift towards an externalized and logically centralized network control plane. A particularly important task in SDN architectures is that of controller placement, i.e., the positioning of a limited number of resources within a network to meet various requirements. These requirements range from latency constraints to failure tolerance and load balancing. In most scenarios, at least some of these objectives are competing, thus no single best placement is available and decision makers need to find a balanced trade-off. This work presents POCO, a framework for Pareto-based Optimal COntroller placement that provides operators with Pareto optimal placements with respect to different performance metrics. In its default configuration, POCO performs an exhaustive evaluation of all possible placements. While this is practically feasible for small and medium sized networks, realistic time and resource constraints call for an alternative in the context of large scale networks or dynamic networks whose properties change over time. For these scenarios, the POCO toolset is extended by a heuristic approach that is less accurate, but yields faster computation times. An evaluation of this heuristic is performed on a collection of real world network topologies from the Internet Topology Zoo. Utilizing a measure for quantifying the error introduced by the heuristic approach allows an analysis of the resulting trade-off between time and accuracy.

EC1,Automated controllers for bandwidth allocation in network virtualization,2013,2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC),M. S. Seddiki; B. Nefzi; Y. Song; M. Frikha,,,1,7,"The concept of network virtualization was introduced to facilitate flexible service deployment for the future Internet. This recent technology provides a powerful tool to run multiple logical networks on the same physical substrate defined as virtual networks (VNs). Each physical link is split into virtual links and each VN receives a fraction of the available capacity. Bandwidth allocation for multiple VMs aims at sharing the physical links among multiple VNs. It is a critical challenge for both service providers (SPs) and infrastructure providers (InPs). This allocation should take into account the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the flows that are crossing each VN. In this paper, we consider a virtualized network environment where the SP deploys multiple VNs with different links' capacity demands and QoS requirements. Each VN competes with other VNs to receive fractions of physical links managed by multiple InPs. We present a two-layer controller system that adapts to the dynamic change of the workload of each VN. The system uses a prediction-based approach in order to find the optimal request for each VN. The request depends on the estimation of the relationship between the VN performance in terms of packet delays and the actual and past allocations. Then, due to the capacity constraint of the physical link, the system adjusts the offered bandwidth for each of them. Our model offers flexible distributed autonomous control of the bandwidth allocation to maintain the offered QoS to each VN at the desired level in response to the dynamics of the workload. Our mechanism provides an optimum allocation of the physical links by distributing the bandwidth periodically. It also offers the possibility of adjusting the VNs' parameters to take into account the current network behaviour to avoid bottleneck virtual links.",10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742795,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742795,network virtualization;dynamic bandwidth allocation;feedback controller,Quality of service;Computational modeling;Monitoring,1,20,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as NFV is an emerging technology, many challenges still need to be addressed. This paper focuses on one of the most important issues from those challenges, namely resource allocation. A two-plan architecture is proposed in order to well explain the service resource allocation process in NFV. So as to show the impact that mapping process has on operators' CAPEX, OPEX and service performances, we also model the mapping cost minimization problem under delay and resource constraints as an integer linear programming problem.

Huang,,,1,6,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) literally pushes cloud computing from remote datacenters to the life radius of end users. By leveraging the widely adopted ETSI network function virtualization (NFV) architecture, MEC provisions elastic and resilient mobile edge applications with proximity. Typical MEC virtualization infrastructure allows configurable placement policy to deploy mobile edge applications as virtual machines (VMs): affinity can be used to put VMs on the same host for inter-VM networking performance, while anti-affinity is to separate VMs for high availability. In this paper, we propose a novel model to track the availability and cost impact from placement policy changes of the mobile edge applications. We formulate our model as a stochastic programming problem. To minimize complexity challenge, we also propose a heuristic algorithm. With our model, the unit resource cost increases when there are less resources left on a host. Applying affinity would take up more resources of the host but saves network bandwidth cost because of co-location. When enforcing anti-affinity, experimental results show increases of both availability and inter-host network bandwidth cost. For applications with different resource requirements, our model is able to find their sweet points with the consideration of both resource cost and application availability, which is vital in a less robust MEC cloud environment.",10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254591,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254591,,Mobile communication;Bandwidth;Mobile computing;Cloud computing;Servers;Edge computing;Network function virtualization,4,19,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assi,,,1,6,"This paper addresses the problem of auto-scaling cloud services (tenants) in a failure prone cloud data center network. Auto-scaling enables existing tenants to modify their services or service availability, for example, to meet market demand fluctuations or to prepare for high-traffic events and scheduled load changes. Cloud operators, in response, need to accommodate such requests by provisioning additional resources or reconfiguring current ones. This manuscript shows that such a decision problem, in addition to being combinatorially complex, is not intuitive, highlighting several tradeoffs between disruption times due to service migration and resource redundancy to achieve higher service availability.

Carapinha,10,4,356,368,"Network Virtualization is claimed to be a key component of the Future Internet, providing the dynamic support of different networks with different paradigms and mechanisms in the same physical infrastructure. A major challenge in the dynamic provision of virtual networks is the efficient embedding of virtual resources into physical ones. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, previous research focused on designing heuristic-based algorithms; most of them either do not consider a simultaneous embedding of virtual nodes and virtual links, or apply link-path formulation, leading to non-optimal solutions. This paper proposes an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to solve the online virtual network embedding problem as a result of an objective function striving for the minimization of resource consumption and load balancing. To this end 3 different objective functions are proposed and evaluated. This approach applies multi-commodity flow constraint to accomplish a node-link formulation that optimizes the allocation of physical network resources. This proposal is evaluated against state of the art heuristics. The performance of the heuristics related to Virtual Network (VN) request acceptance ratio is, at least, 30% below the one of the Virtual Network Embedding Node-Link Formulation (VNE-NLF) method. From the three cost functions evaluated, the Weighted Shortest Distance Path (WSDP) is the one which embeds more VNs and also requires, on average, less physical resources per embedding.",10.1109/TNSM.2013.092813.130397,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616685,Virtual networks;embedding;mapping;NP-hard;optimization;ILP model;heuristics,Virtual networks;Delays;Linear programming;Optimization;Mathematical model;Load management,43,27,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bagaa,36,3,519,528,"The evolution towards 5G consists of managing highly dynamic networks and making decisions related to the provisioning of networks in an as-a-service and cost-aware fashion. This is translated by 5G verticals that are dedicated to specific services, applications, or use cases fulfilling the constant demand of vertical industries. In this vein, to achieve the high-level goals defined by operators and service providers, and to answer to the elasticity and low-latency specifications of the upcoming 5G mobile system, the optimal placement of virtual network functions must cope with the non-uniform service demands and the irregular nature of network topologies. This paper addresses this issue by mapping the non-uniform distribution of signaling messages in the physical domain to a new uniform environment (i.e., canonical domain) whereby the placement of core functions is more feasible and efficient by means of Schwartz-Christoffel conformal mappings. The experimentation results, compared to some baseline approaches, have proven the efficiency of the conformal mapping based placement in allocating the virtual resources (i.e., virtual CPU and virtual storage) with regard to the optimal end-to-end delay, cost and activated virtual machines.

EC2,Towards Bandwidth Guarantee for Virtual Clusters Under Demand Uncertainty in Multi-Tenant Clouds,2018,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,L. Yu; H. Shen; Z. Cai; L. Liu; C. Pu,29,2,450,465,"In the cloud, multiple tenants share the resource of datacenters and their applications compete with each other for scarce network bandwidth. Current studies have shown that the lack of bandwidth guarantee causes unpredictable network performance, leading to poor application performance. To address this issue, several virtual network abstractions have been proposed which allow the tenants to reserve virtual clusters with specified bandwidth between the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the datacenters. However, all these existing proposals require the tenants to deterministically characterize the bandwidth demands in the abstractions, which can be difficult and result in inefficient bandwidth reservation due to the demand uncertainty. In this paper, we explore a virtual cluster abstraction with stochastic bandwidth characterization to address the bandwidth demand uncertainty. We propose Stochastic Virtual Cluster (SVC), which models the bandwidth demand between VMs in a probabilistic way. Based on SVC, we develop a stochastic framework for virtual cluster allocation, in which the admitted virtual cluster's bandwidth demands are satisfied with a high probability. Efficient VM allocation algorithms are proposed to implement the framework while reducing the possibility of link congestion through minimizing the maximum bandwidth occupancy of a virtual cluster on physical links. Using simulations, we show that SVC achieves the trade-off between the job concurrency and the average job running time, and demonstrate its effectiveness for accommodating cloud application workloads with highly volatile bandwidth demands and its improvement to work-conserving bandwidth enforcement.",10.1109/TPDS.2017.2754366,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046038,Cloud computing;bandwidth guarantee;network abstraction;virtual network;virtual machine placement,Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Resource management;Static VAr compensators;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty;Clustering algorithms,4,25,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To offer predictable performance, the virtual cluster abstraction of cloud services has been proposed, which enables allocation and performance isolation regarding both computing resources and network bandwidth in a simplified virtual network model. One issue arisen in virtual cluster allocation is the survivability of tenant services against physical failures. Existing works have studied virtual cluster backup provisioning with fixed primary embeddings, but have not considered the impact of primary embeddings on backup resource consumption. To address this issue, in this paper we study how to embed virtual clusters survivably in the cloud data center, by jointly optimizing primary and backup embeddings of the virtual clusters. We formally define the survivable virtual cluster embedding problem. We then propose a novel algorithm, which computes the most resource-efficient embedding given a tenant request. Since the optimal algorithm has high time complexity, we further propose a faster heuristic algorithm, which is several orders faster than the optimal solution, yet able to achieve similar performance.

The 5G Exchange (5GEx) project, building on the software-defined network and the network function virtualization (NFV) concepts, targets the design and the implementation of a multi-domain orchestrator (MdO) prototype for the automatic provisioning of network service across multiple administrative domains. This paper presents an architectural solution, designed and implemented in the context of the 5GEx MdO prototype, that can be used to establish end-to-end connectivity tunnels with QoS constraints (i.e., bandwidth and/or end-to-end delay) connecting virtualized network functions deployed in remote data centers controlled by different providers by means of an innovative stateful backward recursive path-computation-element-based computation procedure.

Choi,PP,99,1,1,"Energy internet (EI) is a very complex system with various applications that not only require a high-level of cyber-security but also need low-latency communication. Thus, cyberinfrastructure with latency-optimal network intelligence services (NIS), in which application data flows are deeply examined in real-time, is inevitable. In the future internet system, a set of NIS can flexibly be implemented in network function virtualization (NFV)-based middleboxes that overlay on software-defined networking (SDN) architecture, becoming an SDN/NFV-based cyberinfrastructure. However, how to deploy these middleboxes is a non-deterministic optimization problem, which is complicated and time-consuming. Hence, by focusing on latency minimization, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solution consisted of two phases. First, middleboxes placement based on the graph cluster analysis, and second, NIS resource allocation based on the prediction of service usage-ratio in each corresponding cluster. The simulation-based experimental evaluation shows that our proposed strategy using an optimized K-means algorithm outperforms the recent state-of-the-art middleboxes placement approaches.

Harada,,,1,5,"To cope with the increasingly diversifying services, QoS, and network architectures, network virtualization is a promising technology that enables the concurrent deployment of multiple network technologies on a shared network. However, traditional research on network virtualization preliminarily focuses on a wired environment and network virtualization for a wireless environment is not well studied. Considering that in near-future, various wireless technologies will play the most important role in access networks and multi-mode wireless terminals will become more popular, it is crucial to extend the concept of network virtualization to wireless networks. We refer to building such extended virtual networks as ""end-to-end slicing"". The key technical challenges for such extension are (1) abstraction of heterogeneous wireless access networks for maximizing radio frequency utilization and (2) isolation of wireless resources such as radio frequencies, throughput, or name spaces for accommodating multiple virtual networks on a single wireless access network. In this paper, we tackle the first challenge and propose a Cognitive Virtualization Platform, called AMPHIBIA, which enables end-to-end slicing over heterogeneous wired and wireless networks. AMPHIBIA is a platform to provide independent virtual networks each of which can be configured for the corresponding service and to coordinate the resource management in both sides of wired and wireless networks, exploiting the network virtualization and cognitive radio technology. AMPHIBIA is motivated by the shared property of ""reconfigurability"" of network virtualization and cognitive radio, and provides network operators with the capability of cooperative resource allocation over wired and wireless networks. In other words, AMPHIBIA virtualizes a cognitive base station to dynamically configure a wireless access network for each virtual network.

This involves maintaining or improving its performance at a lower operational cost. This need is also aided by the fact that the industry has been experiencing declining profitability.

Recent studies have concluded on container-based virtualization for better performance. However, there are different container providers and choosing a less performant provider increases deployment costs.

Wang,,,766,771,"Video applications using MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, such as YouTube and Netflix) have been dominating the Internet traffic in recent years. It is increasingly acknowledged that in order to provide video clients with better Quality-of-Experience (QoE), both content service providers and network operators need to be aware of clients' QoE in the first place. In this paper, we present a novel real-time QoE estimation system through edge computing, which has been implemented and deployed at a real LTE-A network edge. When equipped with such a system, any virtual network function (VNF) deployed in a mobile network will be able to infer all DASH clients' QoE under its coverage in real time, where no feedback from clients are needed. Furthermore, our scheme is able to work robustly in busy network environments involving air interface where packet errors frequently occur. The significance of such a scheme is the availability of accurate and real-time knowledge on user QoE through a very lightweight mechanism at the mobile edge, which can be instantaneously used for various content manipulation or resource adaptation operations in order to assure user QoE in dynamic conditions. Through experiments in a real LTE-A network, we demonstrate that our scheme is able to estimate DASH clients' QoE with very high accuracy with very low CPU and RAM footprint.",10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406935,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406935,,Quality of experience;Estimation;Streaming media;Real-time systems;Edge computing;Video recording;Quality assessment,1,12,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Media-based applications are amongst the most demanding services, requiring large bandwidths for high audio-visual quality, low-latency for interactivity, and sufficient infrastructure resources to deliver the computational power for running the media applications in the networked cloud.

The platform offers an advanced cognitive management environment for the provisioning of network services (NSs) and media-related applications, which directly link their lifecycle management with user experience as well as optimization of infrastructure resource utilization. Another innovation of 5G-MEDIA SVP is the integration of serverless computing with media intensive applications in 5G networks, increasing cost effectiveness of operation and simplifying development and deployment time. The proposed SVP is being validated against three media use cases: 1) immersive virtual reality 3-D gaming application; 2) remote production of broadcast content incorporating user generated contents; and 3) dynamically adaptive content distribution networks for the intelligent distribution of ultrahigh definition content.

As a simple and straightforward approach, the static bandwidth allocation in virtual networks (VNs) can often be inefficient in practice, and the adaptive allocation scheme with a small time-scale may lead to the transient network and service instability. Due to the fact that the traffic patterns vary over time, the challenge still remains to meet the expected resources allocation whilst promote the network scalability and robustness. In this paper, based on the robust optimization theory we present a robust dynamic approach which periodically identifies bandwidth allocation to VNs to work reasonable well for a range of traffic patterns over a period of time, rather than certain traffic pattern instance. This problem is formulated as a robust optimization problem using path-flow model aiming to compute the minimum-cost bandwidth allocation.

In this paper, we introduce Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in conjunction with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to minimize the cost via joint orchestration of caching, transcoding and routing functions. Specifically, we propose a two-step iterative approach. First, in NFV-based resource allocation phase, we maximize total cache hits by optimally allocating storage and computing resources for a giving routing policy. Second, in SDN-based routing phase, we minimize the networking cost by optimally configuring the routing matrix for a given resource placement. Finally, we analytically prove their iterative repeat converges to the joint optimum. Through extensive simulations, we verify its convergence, and performance gains compared with the optimal solution of either phase alone. By examining numerical results, we obtain some operational guidelines. From the resource allocation aspect, we should allocate more resources to the node with heavier request rate. From the routing aspect, for each node-server pair, the node should split the traffic across multiple paths with identical shortest hops if there are many, or use the shortest path alone if there is only one.",10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145311,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145311,,Routing;Resource management;Transcoding;Streaming media;Bit rate;Joints;Media,10,33,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lai; Y. Wang; K. Chiu,,,472,477,"In recent years, network functions virtualization (NFV) has been well perceived as the driving force behind innovations of the 5G system, such as slicing precious system resources for differential service needs. In this paper, we propose a container-based design of virtual evolved packet core (vEPC) slice and its light-weight version (LW-vEPC) based on the OpenAirInterface (OAI) software package. We have successfully containerized, and thus virtualized, the EPC component functions into two separate containers: the control-plane (CP) container for virtual home subscriber server (vHSS) and virtual mobility management entity (vMME), and the data-plane (DP) container for virtual serving and packet data network gateway (vSPGW). Via a joint configuration design of virtual linking, binding and bridging, including appropriate source and destination network address translation (SNAT and DNAT), both the intra-container and inter-container communications have been successfully realized. An OAI-based joint test of vEPC with a small-cell base station (ENB) has also been successfully demonstrated via a downlink video streaming showcase from the Internet to a cellular phone. The DP container itself can also perform as a LW-EPC slice near the mobile edge of ENB to greatly reduce the latency for time-critical applications. The resource allocation methodology of multiple CPU cores for vEPC and LW-EPC slicing is being developed.

Wang,27,11,3381,3396,"Network virtualization has enabled new business models by allowing infrastructure providers to lease or share their physical network. A fundamental management problem that cloud providers face to support customized virtual network (VN) services is the virtual network embedding. This requires solving the (NP-hard) problem of matching constrained virtual networks onto the physical network. In this paper we present VINEA, a policy-based virtual network embedding architecture, and its system implementation. VINEA leverages our previous results on VN embedding optimality and convergence guarantees, and it is based on a network utility maximization approach that separates policies (i.e., high-level goals) from underlying embedding mechanisms: resource discovery, virtual network mapping, and allocation on the physical infrastructure. We show how VINEA can subsume existing embedding approaches, and how it can be used to design novel solutions that adapt to different scenarios, by merely instantiating different policies. We describe the VINEA architecture, as well as our object model: our VINO protocol and the API to program the embedding policies; we then analyze key representative tradeoffs among novel and existing VN embedding policy configurations, via event-driven simulations, and with our prototype implementation. Among our findings, our evaluation shows how, in contrast to existing solutions, simultaneously embedding nodes and links may lead to lower providers' revenue. We release our implementation on a testbed that uses a Linux system architecture to reserve virtual node and link capacities.

Sahoo,37,5,1029,1045,"Virtual network embedding (VNE) is the process of embedding the set of interconnected virtual machines onto the set of interconnected physical servers (PSs) in the cloud computing environment. The level of complexity of VNE problem increases when a large number of virtual machines with a set of resource demand need to be embedded onto a network of thousands of PSs. The key challenge of VNE is the efficient mapping of virtual networks (VNs), which may have dynamic resource demands. Existing solutions mainly emphasize on the embedding of static VN resulting in poor resource utilization and very low acceptance rate. To tackle such level of complexity in VNE, a fitness-based dynamic virtual network embedding (DYVINE) algorithm is proposed with the goal to maximize the resource utilization by maximizing the acceptance rate. Local and global fitness values of the virtual machines and VN, respectively, are used to utilize the maximum amount of physical resources. The proposed VNE algorithm allows the VN to be dynamic, which indicates that the structure and resource demand can be changed during its execution time. Furthermore, in order to reduce the embedding time in each time slot, a set of PSs is selected to host the VN instead of considering thousands of PSs, which may significantly increase the embedding time.

Guo,6,,159,170,"Multi-tenant software-defined networks have emerged as a promising service platform to manage and share virtual network services between tenants and end-users. However, when using a service level agreement (SLA) in a multi-tenant circumstance, the resource competition among tenants incurred in many challenges on the quality of services (QoS) provisioning. First, as the existing QoS provisioning was to translate the high-level SLA contact into a group of corresponding low-level QoS rules, this traditional top-down translation mechanism was too ossified to support the dynamic SLA negotiation. Second, since an end-user usually requested multiple services and different services had different QoS requirements, the QoS provisioning required tenants to monitor and control the network status though OpenFlow protocol in a fine-grained way. To address these issues, we propose an SLA-aware fine-grained QoS provisioning (SFQP) scheme for MTSDN. The SFQP scheme extracts the eigen characteristics of each packet by applicationaware technology automatically. Considering tenants are more willing to serve for users which have popular SLA contact to earn more revenues, we predict the SLA popularity by K-nearest neighbor. Moreover, we present an SLA-aware dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm to implement the proposed SFQP scheme.

The need for interoperability among these autonomous cloud-based service providers has created demand for versatile and extensible exchange points to interconnect the future Internet. A novel SDX (Software Defined Exchange) can address this challenge and help redefine the Internet exchange by leveraging SDN. Current implementations of SDXs have focused on traffic exchange between conventional IP networks and have not been specifically intended for exchange between multi-tenant environments and virtual networks; and they have mostly relied on OpenFlow for network forwarding and functionality. While OpenFlow is the de-facto solution for fine-grained forwarding, it nevertheless provides limited network functionality.

EC2,Virtual Network Embedding Using Node Multiple Metrics Based on Simplified ELECTRE Method,2018,IEEE Access,P. Zhang; H. Yao; C. Qiu; Y. Liu,6,,37314,37327,"The concept of network virtualization has attracted significant attention from academia to industry. One of the key challenges in network virtualization is the resource allocation problem, which is also termed the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. It involved with mapping virtual networks onto a substrate network by adhering to some constraints, such as CPU capacity, on the nodes and bandwidth resources on the links. However, prior heuristic VNE algorithms mostly concentrate on measuring the embedding potential of substrate nodes using the multiplication of different nodes' resource metrics. Due to the fact that different resource metrics have different impacts on node ranking, these traditional methods have some limitations that would cause unbalanced embedding problems. Furthermore, the number of hops for the substrate paths that virtual links are mapped onto will have a large impact on the resource utilization of substrate links in a substrate network. In this paper, based on the topology analysis of six situations, we first propose a novel five-node ranking metric to quantify the importance of substrate nodes. Then, we give a comprehensive measurement method for substrate nodes using the simplified ELECTRE method to avoid an unbalanced embedding solution. We present a novel two-stage VNE algorithm, which chooses the substrate nodes with the maximum embedding potential to perform the node mapping procedure, and uses the shortest path algorithm to accomplish the link mapping procedure.

While many solutions for the online VNE problem exist, only few have focused on methods that can be generally applied for optimization of online embeddings. In this paper, we propose an admission control based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to improve the overall system performance for the online VNE problem. Before running a VNE algorithm to embed a virtual network request, the RNN predicts whether the request will be accepted by the VNE algorithm based on the current state of the substrate and the virtual network request (VNR). The RNN prevents VNE algorithms from spending time on VNRs that are either infeasible or that cannot be embedded in acceptable time. In order to train and operate the RNN efficiently, we additionally propose new representations for substrate networks and virtual network requests. The representations are based on topological and network resource features to represent the substrate network and the VNRs with low computational complexity. Via simulations, we show that our admission control reduces the overall computational time for the online VNE problem by up to 91 % while preserving VNE performance on average.

A key step lies in mapping a virtual network request to a resource allocation in the network substrate. Previous approaches to this network embedding problem assumed the request will ask for specific resources, such as network capacity or computing power. However, the end-user is more interested in performance. This paper therefore considers a different request format, namely a request will ask for a certain quality of service (QoS). The infrastructure provider must then determine the resource allocation necessary for this QoS. In particular, the provider must take into account user reaction to perceived performance and adjust the allocation dynamically. To this end, we propose an estimation mechanism that is based on analyzing the interaction between user behavior and network performance.

Our results show that container-based instantiations not only incur lower resource usage but also have shorter boot time. This makes containers an attractive choice for fine-grained VNF resource flexing. The lessons learned from our empirical case studies with EPC and IDS provide important guidelines for building an elastic micro-service architecture for NFV deployments.",10.1109/NFV-SDN.2016.7919486,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7919486,,Containers;Metals;Hardware;Computer architecture;Virtualization;Conferences,8,20,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Li,67,10,9896,9910,"In this paper, a dynamic radio resource slicing framework is presented for a two-tier heterogeneous wireless network. Through software-defined networking-enabled wireless network function virtualization, radio spectrum resources of heterogeneous wireless networks are partitioned into different bandwidth slices for different base stations (BSs). This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and intercell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm.

Guo; Y. Zhang; L. Wang; Z. Han; P. Zhang,,,1,6,"Wireless network virtualization has been envisioned as a promising technology to enhance resource utilization and reduce expenditure. In this paper, we propose a virtual resource allocation strategy in a mobile virtual network, which reuses spectrum resource to reduce the physical resource that service providers (SPs) need to purchase and also enhance spectrum efficiency. Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) benefit not only from sales of the spectrum resource, but also from its reuse levels by SPs. However, the SP's service quality requirement and user channel state information are hidden information to the MVNO, and are the basis needed for the MVNO's resource allocation design. Besides, how many users will be arranged to reuse is a hidden action, independently decided by the SPs themselves, which the MVNO is unable to know. To deal with the two kinds of asymmetric information problems, we design contracts which include two parts of fees charged for each SP. First of all, SPs are classified into different types based on their distinct characteristics and assigned with corresponding resource prices to deal with the hidden information problem. Then to incentivize higher resource reuse level, rank-order tournament (ROT) design is adopted to obtain the MVNO's commission rates for SPs.

Hong,37,8,1794,1807,"Wireless network slicing (i.e., network virtualization) is one of the potential technologies for addressing the issue of rapidly growing demand in mobile data services related to 5G cellular networks. It logically decouples the current cellular networks into two entities: infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The resources of base stations (e.g., resource blocks, transmission power, and antennas), which are owned by the InP, are shared with multiple MVNOs who need resources for their mobile users. Specifically, the physical resources of an InP are abstracted into multiple isolated network slices, which are then allocated to MVNO's mobile users. In this paper, two-level allocation problem in network slicing is examined while enabling efficient resource utilization, inter-slice isolation (i.e., no interference among slices), and intra-slice isolation (i.e., no interference between users in the same slice). A generalized Kelly mechanism (GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource allocation issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed. The benefit of using such a resource bidding and allocation framework is that the seller (InP) does not need to know the true valuation of the bidders (MVNOs). For solving the lower level of resource allocation issue (i.e., between MVNOs and their mobile users), the optimal resource allocation is derived from each MVNO to its mobile users by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Then, bandwidth resources are allocated to the users of MVNOs.

As IPTV gains popularity, creating virtual networks for IPTV Service Providers can allow them to deploy specific protocol suites, routing algorithms and resource allocation strategies without affecting other IPTV providers that share the same underlying infrastructure. However, from the perspective of the underlying networking infrastructure provider (the “carrier”) virtualization presents new management challenges, in particular how to efficiently and fairly allocate available resources to multiple virtual networks. In this paper we describe a framework in which management systems associated with virtual IPTV provider networks communicate with the management system of the carrier to provide coordinated resource allocation. The proposed approach allows policy-based management systems to control a bio-inspired resource management mechanism, based on species competition for biological systems, that a carrier can use to allocate resources to competing IPTV providers in a manner that maximizes the carrier's revenue.

Cao,,,71,76,"Network visualization in Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) utilizes the flexible spectral resources to map Virtual Networks (VN) requests onto the physical substrate network. The process of mapping the VN requests onto the physical substrate network is called Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem. The use of EONs in network virtualization brings in an additional requirement of satisfying the spectrum-continuity and sub-carrier consecutiveness constraints. In transparent VNE (t-VNE), all the virtual links from a VN request must be mapped to the substrate links with the same set of sub-carriers. This makes t-VNE even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel t-VNE algorithm called Alignment and Consecutiveness-aware Transparent Virtual Network Embedding (ACT-VNE), which takes into account the spectrum alignment and consecutiveness between adjacent fiber links when mapping virtual nodes onto the physical substrate nodes. We also introduce an extended scheme, namely, Importance, Alignment and Consecutiveness-aware Transparent Virtual Network Embedding (iACTs-VNE) that assigns virtual nodes to substrate nodes within close proximity to establish connections with less bandwidth utilization.

In this paper, we consider the virtual network embedding problem in fat-tree data centers. We design various schemes to embed Nonblocking Multicast Virtual Networks (NMVNs) which are dedicated to deliver premium experience to cloud users. In each NMVN, there is a free combination of virtual machines selected from variable sizes. The bottleneck of communications between these virtual machines is removed so that they can always send data at full bandwidth of their network interface, even if data is simultaneously sent to multiple destinations. In addition, the high performance of NMVNs is guaranteed at the wellcontrolled low network hardware cost. We design two embedding schemes for NMVNs, named Static NMVN Embedding (SNE) and Dynamic NMVN Embedding (DNE). Both schemes support the nonblocking properties for multicast. Besides, each of the two schemes has its unique features. The SNE scheme provides an interference-free solution, in the sense that a virtual network is not aware of the existence of other virtual networks during its lifetime. The DNE scheme has lower hardware cost than SNE and provides higher flexibility to cloud users by possible reconfigurations when necessary.

In the future Internet multiple virtual networks will coexist on top of the same physical infrastructure, and these will compete for bandwidth resources. Link dimensioning can support fair share and allocation of bandwidth. Current approaches however, are ineffective at smaller timescales or require traffic measurements that are not easy to obtain. In this thesis we focused on easy to deploy and accurate link dimensioning approaches for the future Internet. The start point of our work is a dimensioning formula, proposed in 2006, built upon the assumption of Gaussian traffic. This formula is able to accurately estimate required capacity at very small timescales. To do so it requires traffic statistics that can be obtained from packet captures. The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First, we prove that the assumption of Gaussian traffic holds for current Internet traffic and, hence, the dimensioning formula can still be applied. Second, instead of relying on costly packet captures, we develop and validate link dimensioning approaches that estimate the needed traffic statistics from measurement data obtained via technologies that are largely found in today's networks (namely, sFlow and NetFlow/IPFIX). Our approaches are able to accurately estimate required capacity at timescales as low as 1ms.

CA can aggregate multiple contiguous or non-contiguous Component Carriers (CCs) and to improve frequency spectrum utilization and signal quality. In 5G NR, NFV can dynamically allocate network virtual radio resource for different classes of network slicing, e.g., emergency, uRLLC for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), e.g., Autonomous Self Driving Vehicle, Advanced Driving Assistant System, mMTC for sensing-based Internet of Things (IoTs), etc. However, different SINRs of different frequency spectrum bands suffer from the exiting radio nature of CCs.

To deliver IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) advanced services across multiple access networks, a cloud-based model likely improves not only flexibility in network management but also in service invocation. This model is particularly suitable for the inter-network between the IMS and Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) domain, which is a natural combination to significantly expand potential end-points of multimedia sessions. However, optimally allocating resource for each component in the system to provide QoS is challenging, and has not been fully considered in prior work. In this paper, we investigate an NFV architecture to enable effective communication between IMS and WebRTC users supporting smart community services, and propose an optimization model to design and allocate resources for such system while ensuring desired QoS level. Experimental results show our algorithms effectively allocate required amounts of resources for virtual components according to real-time increase or decrease in user demand.",10.1109/NETWKS.2016.7751157,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751157,,Registers;Quality of service;WebRTC;Levee;Logic gates;Technological innovation,6,27,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MEC environments, Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) are deployed for provisioning network services to users to reduce the service cost on top of dedicated hardware infrastructures. However, VNFs may suffer from failures and malfunctions while network service providers have to guarantee continuously reliable services to their users to meet ever-growing service demands of the users. In this paper, we focus on reliable VNF service provisioning in MECs, by provisioning primary and backup VNF instances in order to meet the reliability requirements of mobile users. We first formulate a novel VNF service reliability problem with the aim to maximize the revenue collected by admitting as many as user requests while meeting individual user service reliability requirements. We then develop two efficient on-line scheduling algorithms for the problem under two different backup schemes: on-site (local) and off-site (remote) schemes, by adopting the primal and dual updating technique. Particularly for the on-site scheme, the proposed on-line algorithm achieves a provable competitive ratio with bounded moderate resource violations.

In such a system, virtualized Network Functions (NFs) need to be consistently migrated from one instance to another in various network applications, such as resource optimization, fault tolerance, load balancing, etc. These migrations involve simultaneously coordinating updates to the NF state and SDN forwarding state. To solve this problem, we design two consistent NF state update schemes: a controller-forwarding based scheme and a tagging-based scheme. Through analysis of the update process, we demonstrate that they both guarantee loss-free and order-preserving migrations. We further implement a prototype and carry out experiments with diverse traffic settings. Results demonstrate that the controller-forwarding based solution achieves 77% migration time compared with the state- of-the-art solution OpenNF, while correcting an error in latter's algorithm. Moreover, the tagging-based solution not only achieves 4.4% migration time, but also reduces up to 75% controller overhead compared with OpenNF at the cost of adding a tag in the unused fields of packet header.",10.1109/TSC.2017.2765636,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8081824,Software-defined networks;virtualized network function;state consistency;network function migration,Noise measurement;Process control;Control systems;Network function virtualization;Computer architecture;Optimization,5,,IEEE Early Access Articles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OK,Virtual network reconfiguration in elastic optical path networks for future bandwidth allocation,2016,IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking,T. Ohba; S. Arakawa; M. Murata,8,9,633,644,"Given the limited number of resources (i.e., frequency slots and transponders at optical switches) in elastic optical networks, one approach to accommodating traffic demand is for the network operator to offer a certain number of leased lightpaths in response to requests from service providers, while configuring a virtual network (VN) that accommodates the traffic demands of other consumers. It is essential to reconfigure the VN according to changes in traffic while setting aside resources for leased lightpaths and accommodating increased traffic demand on the VN. Our research group has proposed a VN reconfiguration method for traditional wavelength division multiplexing networks based on attractor selection, which is a model of the behavior by which living organisms adapt to unknown changes in their surrounding environment. However, simply adopting this method cannot make the best use of elastic optical networks since it assigns all wavelengths to accommodate the current traffic demand, which leads to a lack of resources for accommodating the future traffic demand. In this paper, we therefore propose a method for reconfiguring a VN over an elastic optical network. To set aside resources for future traffic demands, we newly define the potential bandwidth as a metric that reflects the bandwidth that can be additionally offered. Our method reconfigures a VN based on attractor selection using information about the service quality on the VN and the potential bandwidth, and it also adjusts the bandwidths of all the lightpaths that form the VN. The evaluation results show that our method can reconfigure a VN so the service quality on the VN is improved while keeping some resources unused.",10.1364/JOCN.8.000633,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563694,Attractor selection;Elastic optical network;Virtual network;VN reconfiguration,Optical fiber networks;Bandwidth;Optical switches;Adaptation models;Transponders;Optical fibers,4,,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wang,,,2397,2400,"In a virtual internet architecture, multiple routing architectures can run on a shared physical infrastructure, which is carried out with network virtualization. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a bandwidth allocation algorithm based on multi-commodity flow problem solver integrated with a traffic predictor: linear predictor with dynamic error compensation (L-PREDEC). The basic idea of our design is that some failure in the MFP computation implies that one or more links do not have enough available capacity, which violates the linear constraints on the commodities for each link when modeling MFP. To avoid producing bottleneck links, we employed traffic predictor. On one hand, MFP solver makes better resource utilization by making use of the thin pieces of available bandwidth, by which the virtual network can accept more service requests. On the other hand, the traffic predictor adjusts the link with the largest occupation (bottleneck link) by periodically monitoring the traffic rate of a user link and adjusting the reserved bandwidth based on the prediction made from the traffic history. Then we present the results of performance comparisons of the predictor-integrated algorithm and the allocation algorithm only by Solving MFP. The comparisons are based on the mean packet delay, the variance of the packet delay, and the buffer requirements. Our performance tests show that predictor-integrated algorithm works better than the allocation algorithm only by Solving MFP in terms of the three metrics listed above.",10.1109/CCDC.2016.7531386,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7531386,bandwidth allocation;traffic prediction;virtual network;linear predictor,Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Quality of service;Resource management;Algorithm design and analysis,,18,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Develder,,,3462,3468,"Optical networks are crucial to support increasingly demanding cloud services. Delivering the requested quality of services (in particular latency) is key to successfully provisioning end-to-end services in clouds. Therefore, as for traditional optical network services, it is of utter importance to guarantee that clouds are resilient to any failure of either network infrastructure (links and/or nodes) or data centers. A crucial concept in establishing cloud services is that of network virtualization: the physical infrastructure is logically partitioned in separate virtual networks. To guarantee end-to-end resilience for cloud services in such a set-up, we need to simultaneously route the services and map the virtual network, in such a way that an alternate routing in case of physical resource failures is always available. Note that combined control of the network and data center resources is exploited, and the anycast routing concept applies: we can choose the data center to provide server resources requested by the customer to optimize resource usage and/or resiliency.

Chowdhury; M. Tornatore; R. Boutaba; J. Mitra; M. Hemmati,,,1,12,"Elastic Optical Network (EON) virtualization has recently emerged as an enabling technology for 5G network slicing. A fundamental problem in EON slicing (known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE)) is how to efficiently map a virtual network (VN) on a substrate EON characterized by elastic transponders and flexible grid. Since a number of 5G services will have strict latency requirements, the VNE problem in EONs must be solved while guaranteeing latency targets. In existing literature, latency has always been modeled as a constraint applied on the virtual links of the VN. In contrast, we argue in favor of an alternate modeling that constrains the latency of virtual paths. Constraining latency over virtual paths (vs. over virtual links) poses additional modeling and algorithmic challenges to the VNE problem, but allows us to capture end-to-end service requirements. In this paper, we first model latency in an EON by identifying the different factors that contribute to it. We formulate the VNE problem with latency guarantees as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and propose a heuristic solution that can scale to large problem instances. We evaluated our proposed solutions using real network topologies and realistic transmission configurations under different scenarios and observed that, for a given VN request, latency constraints can be guaranteed by accepting a modest increase in network resource utilization. Latency constraints instead showed a higher impact on VN blocking ratio in dynamic scenarios.",10.1109/ICNP.2019.8888056,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8888056,,Substrates;Optical fiber networks;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Adaptive optics;Virtualization,,65,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will make networks more flexible, dynamic, and cost-efficient, while greatly simplifying operational complexity. And this advanced solution provides several benefits including network and service customizability, configurability, improved operations, and increased performance. There are several approaches to SDN and its practical implementation. Among them, two have risen to prominence with differences in pedigree and implementation. This paper's main focus will be to define, review, and evaluate salient approaches and use cases of the OpenFlow and Virtual Network Overlay approaches to SDN. OpenFlow is a communication protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network's switches and routers.

By extending SDN framework to support virtual network interface, the traditional controller has a global view of network and calculates the IP stream policy for the mobile terminal with multiple virtual network interface. Local agent and flow manager are extended on mobile terminal to maintain the state of virtual interfaces and allocate the data-flows to different virtual interfaces.

Robbert; H. Karl,,,387,395,"In distributed cloud computing, application deployment across multiple sites can improve quality of service. Recent research developed algorithms to find optimal locations for virtual machines. However, those algorithms assume to have either single-tier applications or a fixed number of virtual machines -- a strong simplification of reality. This paper investigates the placement and scaling of complex application architectures. An application is dynamically scaled to fit both the current demand situation and the currently available infrastructure resources. We compare two approaches: The first one is based on virtual network embedding. The second approach is a novel method called Template Embedding. It is based on a hierarchical 1-allocation hub flow problem and combines application scaling and embedding in one step. Extensive experiments on 43200 network configurations showed that Template Embedding outperforms virtual network embedding in all cases in three metrics: success rate, solution quality, and runtime. This positive result shows that template embedding is a promising approach for distributed cloud resource allocation.",10.1109/UCC.2014.49,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027516,Distributed Cloud Computing;Cloud Resource Allocation;Flow Problem;Hub Problem;Application Architecture,Substrates;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing;Runtime;Complexity theory;Optimization;Cloud computing,4,30,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shen; L. Yu; L. Chen; Z. Li,,,1,8,"The shared nature of cloud network infrastructures causes unpredictable network performance, which may degrade the performance of these applications. Recently, several works propose to explicitly reserve the network bandwidth in the cloud with virtual network abstraction models, which pre-specify the network bandwidth between virtual machines (VMs) for a tenant job. However, the pre-specification fails to exploit the elastic feature of the bandwidth resource (i.e., more reserved bandwidth within no-elongation threshold bandwidth leads to shorter job execution time and vice versa) in job scheduling. It is difficult for ordinary tenants (without specialized network knowledge) to estimate the exact needed bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new cloud job scheduler, in which each tenant only needs to specify job deadline and each job's reserved bandwidth is elastically determined by leveraging the elastic feature to maximize the total job rewards, which represent the worth of successful completion by deadlines. Finally, the scheduler tries to reduce the execution time of each job. It also jointly considers the computational capacity of VMs and reserved VM bandwidth in job scheduling. Using trace-driven and real cluster experiments, we show the efficiency and effectiveness of our job scheduler in comparison with other scheduling strategies.",10.1109/CloudCom.2016.0017,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830658,Bandwidth allocation;job scheduling;system reward,Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Optimal scheduling;Resource management;Switches;Scheduling;Topology,8,27,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tan,16,2,591,605,"Network slicing enables diversified services to be accommodated by isolated slices in network function virtualization-enabled software-defined networks. To maintain satisfactory user experience and high profit for service providers in a dynamic environment, a slice may need to be reconfigured according to the varying traffic demand and resource availability. However, frequent reconfigurations incur certain cost and might cause service interruption. In this paper, we propose a hybrid slice reconfiguration (HSR) framework, where a fast slice reconfiguration (FSR) scheme reconfigures flows for individual slices at the time scale of flow arrival/departure, while a dimensioning slices with reconfiguration (DSR) scheme is occasionally performed to adjust allocated resources according to the time-varying traffic demand. In order to optimize the slice's profit, i.e., the total utility minus the resource consumption and reconfiguration cost, we formulate the problems for FSR and DSR, which are difficult to solve due to the discontinuity and non-convexity of the reconfiguration cost function. Hence, we approximate the reconfiguration cost function with L1 norm, which preserves the sparsity of the solution, thus facilitating restricting reconfigurations. Besides, we design an algorithm to schedule FSR and DSR, so that DSR is timely triggered according to the traffic dynamics and resource availability to improve the profit of slice. Furthermore, we extend HSR with a resource reservation mechanism, which reserves partial resources for near future traffic to reduce potential reconfigurations. Numerical results validate that our reconfiguration framework is effective in reducing reconfiguration overhead and achieving high profit for slices.",10.1109/TNSM.2019.2899609,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642931,Network slicing;fast slice reconfiguration;slice dimensioning;L₁ norm optimization;SDN;NFV,Network slicing;Resource management;Pricing;Dynamic scheduling;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Cost function,2,39,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such network service is ""service chaining"", where the complexity of the data path forwarding is coupled with the heterogeneity of service functions. This makes it extremely difficult to monitor and troubleshoot networks with a reasonable resource overhead. We propose a framework that can be applied for service chain monitoring. A monitoring hierarchy is defined, which converts a monitoring intent to monitoring zones and probes for on-demand monitoring. To minimize the cost of probe deployment, we design a heuristic algorithm that conducts dynamic pruning and search.

Most prior literature considers the conservative resource allocation strategy where the maximum resource requirement of virtual requests is always satisfied during their life time regardless of the resource requirement fluctuation. Such methods will definitely result in the resource wastage. By taking into account the time-varying resource requirement, we propose a novel virtual machine placement method, named MIE (Matching-based Integration for Embedding) in this paper. The key part of MIE is to enhance the resource utilization of physical machines (PM) and reduce their utilization fluctuation over time dimension by integrating the requirements with different variation tendencies.

Network function virtualization and cloud computing are two important concepts that can be leveraged to address those challenges in IMS environments. In this work, we propose two adaptive SLA-based elasticity management algorithms for virtualized IMS environments. Our proposed algorithms use two SLA attributes (the call setup delay and user priority) to dynamically control the CPU resources allocated/de-allocated to virtualized IMS nodes. The aims of our proposed algorithms are: 1) to ensure efficient usage and sharing of CPU resources by various IMS components; 2) to reduce the overall power consumption in virtualized IMS platforms; and 3) to enhance the user experience when using IMS networks.

It defines the purpose of the honeypot, the basic component of a honeynet, as ""an information system resource whose value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource"". The objective of a honeynet is to attract malicious attackers, study their offensive strategy, and track every movement they make. The honeynet becomes a useful tool as one analyzes the data gathered from it to build new security into their system. Including a honeynet project in a Brigham Young University IT security curriculum provides hands-on experience with the dynamic Internet and all of the security components that go into securing a network. A VMware environment was used to create a virtual honeynet (Virtual) and compare its effectiveness to a network of physical computers (Real). This allowed students to learn the strengths and weaknesses of both Real and Virtual systems, and better prepare them to work with both. The areas in which Virtual and Real were compared are setup, deployment, maintenance, data collection, and data analysis. Virtual required only one computer whereas Real required one for each honeynet function. Setup was the area of greatest difference as Virtual dealt with virtual components whereas Real involved physical components. The issue of not being able to disguise a virtual network to appear ""real"" is the major concern as a honeynet is only as effective as it appears to be a real, functioning network. Likewise, it is only as good as the data it collects. Maintenance of the networks is where Virtual gained the advantage over Real. One must constantly rebuild the honeypots as they get attacked and trashed. This returning to a base build is much more efficient in the Virtual realm.

This paper presents the design and evaluation of a bandwidth allocation algorithm based on multi-commodity flow problem solver integrated with a traffic predictor: linear predictor with dynamic error compensation (L-PREDEC). The basic idea of our design is that some failure in the MFP computation implies that one or more links do not have enough available capacity, which violates the linear constraints on the commodities for each link when modeling MFP. To avoid producing bottleneck links, we employed traffic predictor. On one hand, MFP solver makes better resource utilization by making use of the thin pieces of available bandwidth, by which the virtual network can accept more service requests. On the other hand, the traffic predictor adjusts the link with the largest occupation (bottleneck link) by periodically monitoring the traffic rate of a user link and adjusting the reserved bandwidth based on the prediction made from the traffic history. Then we present the results of performance comparisons of the predictor-integrated algorithm and the allocation algorithm only by Solving MFP. The comparisons are based on the mean packet delay, the variance of the packet delay, and the buffer requirements. Our performance tests show that predictor-integrated algorithm works better than the allocation algorithm only by Solving MFP in terms of the three metrics listed above.",10.1109/ICINIS.2010.166,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693766,bandwidth allocation;traffic prediction;virtual network;linear predictor,Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Quality of service;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling,4,21,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vision of all vehicles connected poses a crucial challenge for an individual vehicle system to efficiently support these applications. Network virtualization is a very promising enabling solution, by allowing multiple isolated and heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs), to satisfy the different quality of service (QoS) requirements. Smart identifier network (SINET) may provide VNs through effective resources allocation and control based on its model of three layers and two domains. In this paper, we provide resource allocation and mapping of the vehicular networks through elastic network virtualization based on SINET. The appropriate vehicles are selected and generated as a function group for special service, by which the difference of heterogeneous vehicular resources is hided.

Excellent and reliable network service is important for network development. Moreover, as the number of network users increases, network service construction costs become very high. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is necessary to provide an SFC with excellent performance and low resource costs. In this paper, we re-examine the problem of optimizing the deployment of an SFC to provide users with excellent and resource-saving network service. We propose a heuristic, closed-loop feedback (CLF) algorithm to find the shortest path to map an SFC. To solve the problem, we introduce and integrate a restricted Boltzmann machine and cross entropy to improve the performance of CLF. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of CLF.

Recent proposals address this issue either by statically reserving a slice of the physical infrastructure for each application or by providing proportional sharing among flows. The former approach results in overprovisioned network resources, while the latter requires substantial management overhead. In this paper, we introduce a resource allocation strategy that aims at providing an efficient way to predictably share bandwidth among applications and at minimizing resource underutilization while maintaining low management overhead. To demonstrate the benefits of the strategy, we develop IoNCloud, a system that implements the proposed allocation scheme. IoNCloud employs the abstraction of attraction/repulsion among applications according to their temporal bandwidth demands in order to group them in virtual networks. In doing so, we explore the trade-off between high resource utilization (which is desired by providers to achieve economies of scale) and strict network guarantees (necessary for tenants to run jobs predictably).

Virtual network embedding, a major part of network virtualization, facilitates to provide different kinds of businesses or services by resource sharing. Moreover, due to their elasticity, elastic optical networks are viewed as a very promising solution to support inter-DC networks. This paper focuses on the effectiveness and spectrum fragmentation problem for virtual optical network embedding in elastic optical inter-DC networks by employing multidimensional resources and a topological attribute. In the node mapping, betweenness of a physical node is considered together with multidimensional resource carrying capacity (MRCC) to identify proper matching. Specifically, to reduce the influence of a spectrum fragment, the available spectrum continuity degree is coupled with the computing capacity of a physical node as the MRCC. In the link mapping, a tightest-matching factor is employed for the selection of paths to accommodate virtual links.

Lavacca,7,,46898,46916,"The introduction of network function virtualization (NFV) leads to a new business model in which the Telecommunication Service Provider needs to rent cloud resources to infrastructure provider (InP) at prices as low as possible. Lowest prices can be achieved if the cloud resources can be rented in advance by allocating long-term virtual machines (VM). This is in contrast with the short-term VMs that are rented on demand and have higher costs. For this reason, we propose a proactive solution in which the cloud resource rent is planned in advance based on peak traffic knowledge. We illustrate the problem of determining the cloud resources in cloud infrastructures managed by different InPs and so as to minimize the sum of cloud resource, bandwidth and deployment costs. We formulate an integer linear problem (ILP) and due to its complexity, we introduce an efficient heuristic approach allowing for a remarkable computational complexity reduction. We compare our solution to a reactive solution in which the cloud resources are rented on demand and dimensioned according to the current traffic. Though the proposed proactive solution needs more cloud and bandwidth resources due to its peak allocation, its total resources cost may be lower than the one achieved when a reactive solution is applied. That is a consequence of the higher cost of short-term VMs. For instance, when a reactive solution is applied with traffic variation times of ten minutes, our proactive solution allows for lower total costs when the long-term VM rent is lower than the short-term VM one by 33%.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2908990,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680627,Network function virtualization;cloud infrastructure;short-term virtual machine;Viterbi algorithm,Cloud computing;Bandwidth;Resource management;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Virtual machining;Network function virtualization,5,51,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve seamless virtualization, cloud providers require a system that performs the function of virtual network provisioning.

Three schemes to prioritize connections are used, and their effect is assessed. Moreover, a technique dealing with connections spanning over more than a window is introduced.

Matsuo,2,,176,181,"In current SDN paradigm, an edge-overlay (distributed tunneling) model using L2-in-L3 tunneling protocols, such as VXLAN, has attracted attentions for multi-tenant data center networks. The edge-overlay model can establish rapid-deployment of virtual networks onto existing traditional network facilities, ensure flexible IP/MAC address allocation to VMs, and extend the number of virtual networks regardless of the VLAN ID limitation. However, such model has performance and incompatibility problems on the traditional network environment. For L2 data center networks, this paper proposes a pure software approach that uses Open Flow virtual switches to realize yet another edge-overlay without IP tunneling. Our model leverages a header rewriting method as well as a host-based VLAN ID usage to ensure address space isolation and scalability of the number of virtual networks.

OK,Toward Optimal Resource Allocation of Virtualized Network Functions for Hierarchical Datacenters,2018,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,C. Wang; Y. Lin; J. Wu; P. Lin; R. Hwang,15,4,1532,1544,"Telecommunications service providers (TSPs) previously provided network functions to end users with dedicated hardware, but they are resorting to virtualized infrastructure for reducing costs and increasing flexibility in resource allocation. A representative case is the Central Office Re-architected as Datacenter (CORD) project from AT&T, which aims to deploy virtualized network functions (VNFs) to over 4000 central offices (COs) across the U.S. However, there is a wide spectrum of options for deploying VNFs over the COs, varying from highly distributed to highly centralized manners. The former benefits end users with short response time but has its inherent limitation on utilizing geographically dispersed resources, while the latter allows resources to be better utilized at a cost of longer response time. In this work, we model the TSP's virtualized infrastructure as hierarchical datacenters, namely hierarchical CORD, and provide a resource allocation solution to strike the optimal balance between the two extreme options. Our evaluations reveal that in general, the 3-tier architecture incurs the least cost in case of deploying VNFs under moderate or loose delay constraints. Furthermore, the margin of improvement on the resource allocation cost increases inversely with the overall system utilization rate. Our results also suggest that as heavy request load overwhelms the network infrastructure, the relevant VNFs shall be migrated to lower-tier edge datacenters or to some nearby datacenters with superior network capacity.

In this model, how to share and slice wireless resource is one of the fundamental issues to be addressed. Therefore, we formulate and solve a multi-service resource allocation problem to realize spectrum virtualization. Different from the existing strategies, we decouple the multi-service resource allocation problem in the proposed virtualization model to make it easier to solve. Specifically, it is solved in two stages: inter-slice resource allocation and intra-slice resource scheduling. In the first stage, we formulate the inter-slice resource allocation as a discrete optimization problem and propose a heuristic algorithm to get sub-optimal solution of this NP-hard problem.

To meet these applications needs, architectural enhancements and changes in the current Internet are essential. However, since there exists multiple stakeholders in the current Internet, it is almost impossible to reach an agreement among them on necessary architecture alterations and improvements. Network virtualization has been proposed as a technology that aims at solving this limitation enabling Infrastructure Providers to partition their physical network infrastructures based on user/application requirements into virtual networks. This paper proposes a novel architectural solution for future IP networks based on the concept of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) framework and core IP network virtualization. Virtual IP network composition and virtual IP infrastructure Marketplace are two key innovative mechanisms, which are proposed in this architecture. The proposed virtual IP network composition instantiates multiple concurrent and isolated virtual networks coexisting over the same underlying physical infrastructure.

Although multi queue functions like Receive Side Scaling (RSS) can distribute the load onto multiple CPU cores, there are still problems to be solved such as IRQ core collision of heavy traffic flows as well as competitive resource use between physical and virtual for packet processing. In this paper, we propose a software packet processing unit named VSE (Virtual Switch Extension) to address these problems by adaptively determining softirq cores based on both CPU load and VM-running information. Furthermore, the behavior of VSE can be managed by Open Flow controllers.

For example, hundreds of users issuing Cloud requests for which full, privileged access to Virtual Machines (VMs) is requested, typically require the definition of network separation at layer 2 through the use of virtual LANs (VLANs). However, in large computing centers, due e.g. to the number of installed network switches, to their characteristics, to their heterogeneity, or to management policies, the dynamic or even static definition of many VLANs is often impractical or simply not possible.

In this paper, we propose a virtual cluster abstraction with stochastic bandwidth requirements between VMs, called Stochastic Virtual Cluster (SVC), which probabilistically models the bandwidth demand uncertainty. Based on SVC, we propose a network sharing framework and efficient VM allocation algorithms to ensure that the bandwidth demands of tenants on any link are satisfied with a high probability, while minimizing the bandwidth occupancy cost on links.

The InPs are the owners of resources. They are responsible for maintaining a certain level of quality of service (QoS) at the physical layer. The SPs lease resources from InPs. They offer various services to end users. It is more realistic to think about a scenario with multiple InPs and multiple SPs.

Rawat,,,1,7,"Due to ubiquitous presence of wireless connectivity and surge in internet of things (IoT) devices, the next generation wireless network is predicted to face crunch of resources. Wireless virtualization is regarded as a viable approach to enhance resource utilization efficiency by sharing and reusing the physical resources in the form of slices or virtual networks (VNs). Mobile edge computing (MEC), on the other hand, facilitates task offloading as well as fast content delivery by bringing the computation and cache resources to the edge of the network. In this paper, we investigate virtualization of physical infrastructure that is embedded with MEC resources. In particular, this paper presents resource allocation in adaptive virtualized wireless networks with mobile edge computing. First, we investigate how to create VNs for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) based upon demand from users. Second, after creating the VN, how the MVNO can allocate resources to its users so that the utility (aka revenue) of the MVNO is maximized while satisfying users' quality of service (QoS). For the first problem, we propose an algorithm that incorporates demanded area of the MVNO, demanded spectrum, and computation and cache resources.

VN embedding (VNE) algorithms can efficiently allocate the limited SN resources to VNs and assign a unique identifier to each VN. However, the fixed bit width of VN identifier in the packet header limits the number of VNs, and extending the bit width leads to the increase of the network traffic. In this paper, we consider the label-combination method to generate VN identifiers by combining the link-grained labels with location information. This method requires the efficient allocation of labels, but the existing VN embedding works only consider the CPU and bandwidth resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel embedding model that considers the label, CPU and bandwidth resource constraints.

This paper proposes a WNV framework for LTE where hypervisor does not have direct access to user information, and Resource Block (RB) allocation problem in this framework is investigated by adopting the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to model auction games between InPs and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) where MVNOs have the incentive to bid truthfully to compete for RBs. A unified utility function is utilized to enable MVNOs to determine their own scheduling strategies by setting the parameters in it. The RB allocation problem is formulated to divide the total RB set into different subsets to maximize the summation of reporting valuations of all MVNOs.

Liu,,,116,124,"Perceived as a key enabling technology for the future Internet, Network Virtualization (NV) allows an Infrastructure Provider (InP) to better utilize their Substrate Network (SN) by provisioning multiple Virtual Networks (VNs) from different Service Providers (SPs). A key challenge in NV is to efficiently map the VN requests from SPs on an SN, known as the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem. VNE algorithms are typically online in nature. A VN embedding can become suboptimal over time due to the arrival and departure of other VNs as well as due to changes in SN such as failures. One way to mitigate the impact of such dynamism is to periodically reallocate resources for the existing VNs. VNE reallocation can increase an InP's revenue by decreasing bandwidth consumption and by increasing the possibility of accepting future VNs. In this paper, we study Reallocation of Virtual Network Embedding (ReViNE) problem to minimize the number of over utilized substrate links and total bandwidth cost on the SN. We propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation for the optimal solution (ReViNE-OPT) and a simulated annealing based heuristic (ReViNE-FAST) to solve larger problem instances. Simulation results show that on average our proposed heuristic performs within ~19% of the optimal solution.

EC2,Learning Framework for Virtual Network Function Instance Migration,2018,2018 10th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP),X. Bai; H. Lu; Y. Lu,,,1,7,"To implement service function chains (SFCs), virtual network function instances (VNFIs) are placed on virtual machines decoupled from underlying hardwares. For cloud service providers, satisfying the quality of service of clients and reducing the resource consumption to accommodate more clients are both important. However, in the network with dynamic load, fixed VNFI placement strategies can not reach these goals. VNFI migration, which provides cloud service providers with a flexible fine-tuning strategy, becomes a potential way to solve this problem. In this paper, we formulate the VNFI migration problem with the goal to minimize the total cost in an operational cycle. Then a novel Migration-Monitor-Learning Framework (MMLF) is proposed to solve the VNFI migration problem. The most distinctive work of MMLF is that it solves the action space problem when applying reinforcement learning for VNFI migration. Action space for selection of VNFI for migration is very large and thus results in high complexity and poor convergence performance. To overcome this problem, MMLF involves a dedicated neural network to produce continuous actions under time-varying network load. Moreover, two mapping methods are proposed to map continuous actions to discrete VNFIs selected for migration. We evaluate MMLF and other state-of- the-art approaches with real trace data.

InPs are usually bound by service level agreements to ensure various levels of resource availability for different SPs' virtual networks (VNs). They provision redundant backup resources while embedding an SP's VN request to conform to the SLAs during physical failures in the infrastructure. An extreme backup resource provisioning is to reserve a mutually exclusive backup of each element in an SP's VN request. Such dedicated protection scheme can enable an InP to ensure fast VN recovery, thus, providing high uptime guarantee to the SPs.

Existing flow level bandwidth provisioning solutions suffer from a number of drawbacks, including high implementation complexity, poor performance guarantees, and inefficiency to process variable length packets. In this paper, we study flow level bandwidth provisioning for combined-input-crosspoint-queued switches in the OpenFlow context. We propose the FEBR (Flow lEvel Bandwidth pRovisioning) algorithm, which reduces the switch scheduling problem to multiple instances of fair queueing problems, each employing a well studied fair queueing algorithm. FEBR can tightly emulate the ideal Generalized Processing Sharing model, and accurately guarantee the provisioned bandwidth. Further, we implement FEBR in the OpenFlow version 1.0 software switch.

Mukherjee,25,1,238,249,"One of the primary functions of a cloud service provider is to allocate cloud resources to users upon request. Requests arrive in real-time and resource placement decisions must be made as and when a request arrives, without any prior knowledge of future arrivals. In addition, when a cloud service provider operates a geographically diversified cloud that consists of a large number of small data centers, the resource allocation problem becomes even more complex. This is due to the fact that resource request can have additional constraints on data center location, service delay guarantee, and so on, which is especially true for the emerging network function virtualization application. In this paper, we propose a generalized resource placement methodology that can work across different cloud architectures, resource request constraints, with real-time request arrivals and departures. The proposed algorithms are online in the sense that allocations are made without any knowledge of resource requests that arrive in the future, and the current resource allocations are made in such a manner as to permit the acceptance of as many future arrivals as possible.

With this approach, the cellular networks can be logically decoupled into infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In such scenario, an InP owns wireless resources of base stations (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, antenna, storage capacity, computation capacity) which is shared with multiple MVNOs. Then, each MVNO will allocate the obtained network slices to their mobile users. So, the resource allocation to the users of MVNOs is really challenging. In this paper, we address the power allocation problem in the network virtualization with the objective of maintaining the beneficiary network utilization in an efficient manner, and intra-slice, inter-slice isolation. To address the proposed power allocation problem we adopt the weighted proportional allocation mechanism. Under this mechanism, MVNOs are modeled as bidders who will bid for power for their mobile users and InP is modeled as an auctioneer (i.e., a seller).

Taleb,3,,2055,2064,"Future 5G mobile network architecture is expected to offer capacities to accommodate the inexorable rise in mobile data traffic and to meet further stringent latency and reliability requirements to support diverse high data rate applications and services. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) in 5G has emerged as a key paradigm, promising to augment the capability of mobile devices through provisioning of computational resources on demand, and enabling resource-constrained mobile devices to offload their processing and storage requirements to the cloud infrastructure. Follow-me cloud (FMC), in turn, has emerged as a concept that allows seamless migration of services according to the corresponding users mobility. Meanwhile, software-defined networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that permits the decoupling of the control and data planes of traditional networks and provides programmability and flexibility, allowing the network to dynamically adapt to change traffic patterns and user demands. While the SDN implementations are gaining momentum, the control plane is still suffering from scalability and performance concerns for a very large network. In this paper, we address these scalability and performance issues in the context of 5G mobile networks by introducing a novel SDN/OpenFlow-based architecture and control plane framework tailored for MCC-based systems and more specifically for FMC-based systems where mobile nodes and network services are subject to constraints of movements and migrations. Contrary to a centralized approach with a single SDN controller, our approach permits the distribution of the SDN/OpenFlow control plane on a two-level hierarchical architecture: a first level with a Global FMC Controller (G-FMCC), and a second level with several Local FMC Controllers (L-FMCCs). Thanks to our control plane framework and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concept, the L-FMCCs are deployed on-demand, where and when needed, depending on the global system load.

In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of VNE supporting user mobility. The concepts of interruption penalty and blocking penalty are proposed to quantify the impact of virtual node mobility on infrastructure providers (InPs) and refine the revenue model of InPs. Then we propose a location-constrained 5G VNE algorithm, where a virtual node and virtual link pair embedding method is designed to increase the probability of successful VNE. Based on the proposed VNE algorithm, we further propose a virtual network re-embedding algorithm that can dynamically migrate the embedding of virtual nodes following user mobility. The virtual node migration is triggered by predicting the locations of virtual nodes and selecting the target physical nodes with the minimum number of re-embedding.

EC1,Resource management with virtual paths in ATM networks,1996,IEEE Network,V. J. Friesen; J. J. Harms; J. W. Wong,10,5,10,20,"A virtual path connection (VPC) is a labelled path which can be used to transport a bundle of virtual channel connections (VCCs) and to manage the resources used by these connections. The virtual network is organized as a collection of VPCs which form a VPC, or logical, overlay network. If the VPCs are permanent or semi-permanent and have reserved capacity, establishing new VCCs requires simple connection admission decisions at the VPC terminators of existing VPCs. This would enable faster connection establishment since transit nodes are not involved in the connection setup. The virtual path concept also allows the possibility of segregating traffic types according to quality of service requirements. However, the extent to which VPC provisioning is able to improve network efficiency is dependent on the resource management decisions that determine the VPC topology and capacity allocations. The article surveys resource management using virtual paths in an ATM network. Of interest are techniques which modify the VPC topology and capacity assignments in order to adapt to changing traffic conditions and possible network failures. The resource management activities employed to facilitate such adaptation can be categorized by the timescale on which they operate. On the shortest timescale are strategies for dynamically making minor changes to the VPC topology or capacity assignments. On a somewhat longer timescale are strategies for making more widespread modifications to the VPC overlay network. This would be appropriate for traffic changes based on time of day and for recovering from network failures. Finally, on an even longer timescale, strategies may be employed to design a general VPC overlay network, to be used at startup or after major network upgrades. Solutions to VPC resource management for each of these timescales are discussed.",10.1109/65.539856,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=539856,,Resource management;Intelligent networks;Telecommunication traffic;Network topology;Asynchronous transfer mode;Virtual colonoscopy;Quality of service;Concatenated codes;Routing,33,76,IEEE Magazines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virtual network embedding (VNE) is one of the main challenges for network virtualization. Energy costs of servers in data centers (DCs) aremajor contributions to the power consumption in information and communication technology. Therefore, VNE should consider both acceptance ratio and power consumption. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption in software- defined optical data center networks by reducing the active data centers and power-consuming network components. In addition, the coordinates of nodes and delay of links are considered for a more realistic scenario.

Techniques of dynamic system reconfiguration such as auto-scaling and auto-healing, which are typically provided in cloud services, can help maintain the system availability and good performance even after disturbance events. Such reconfiguration operations should be carefully designed and tested well on the production system (in real use) since the offline test is not enough to guarantee the functionality and performance of the production system after reconfiguration. In this paper, we propose a new test design method, called Live System Evaluation, to test an expected system configuration after reconfiguration operation triggered by disturbance events (e.g., a server failure).

To improve the grade of the inter-domain connectivity service, spectrum converters can be installed in inter-domain nodes or per-AS defragmentation can be performed with a global view.

Cai,,,120,125,"It is expected that the concept of Internet of everything will be realized in 2020 because of the coming of the 5G wireless communication technology. Internet of Things (IoT) services in various fields require different types of network service features, such as mobility, security, bandwidth, latency, reliability and control strategies. In order to solve the complex requirements and provide customized services, a new network architecture is needed. To change the traditional control mode used in the traditional network architecture, the Software Defined Network (SDN) is proposed. First, SDN divides the network into the Control Plane and Data Plane and then delegates the network management authority to the controller of the control layer. This allows centralized control of connections of a large number of devices. Second, SDN can help realizing the network slicing in the aspect of network layer. With the network slicing technology proposed by 5G, it can cut the 5G network out of multiple virtual networks and each virtual network is to support the needs of diverse users. In this work, we design and develop a network slicing framework. The contributions of this article are two folds. First, through SDN technology, we develop to provide the corresponding end-to-end (E2E) network slicing for IoT applications with different requirements. Second, we develop a dynamic network slice resource scheduling and management method based on SDN to meet the services' requirements with time-varying characteristics.

EC1,A non-cooperative game theory model for bandwidth allocation in network virtualization,2012,2012 15th International Telecommunications Network Strategy and Planning Symposium (NETWORKS),M. S. Seddiki; M. Frikha,,,1,6,"Network virtualization is a new technology that aims to allow multiple virtual networks to coexist in the same equipment and hide the heterogeneity of network infrastructure. This technology leads the list of top strategies employed by ISPs to boost their green IT initiatives. A critical issue is how to provide customized and on demand resources for different service providers. Each infrastructure provider should fairly distribute network resources, such as bandwidth of each physical link, buffer space and processing time at each node. In this paper we present a novel game theoretic approach for bandwidth allocation between infrastructure providers (InPs) and service providers (SPs). The proposed approach is based on two-stage non-cooperative games. The first stage of game is the bandwidth negotiation game where a SP requests bandwidth from multiple InPs. Every InP decides whether to accept or to deny its request when the SP would cause link congestion. The second stage of the non-cooperative game is the bandwidth provisioning game, where different SPs compete for an amount of bandwidth in a shared physical link for a given infrastructure provider. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves higher bandwidth utilization, improves network performance, and fairly distributes bandwidth between multiple service providers.",10.1109/NETWKS.2012.6381684,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381684,Network virtualization;Bandwidth allocation;Game theory,Bandwidth;Indium phosphide;Bismuth;Games;Channel allocation;Nash equilibrium,3,13,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, mobile systems are undergoing fast evolution to virtualized infrastructure so as to tackle the ever-growing mobile traffic and the unremitting demand for high data rates. However, existing RAN sharing models intend to expose resource details, e.g., infrastructure and spectrum, to participating network operators of the RAN for resource-sharing purposes, which violates the principles of network abstraction and makes network management even more complicated. This paper presents AppRAN, an application-oriented framework for RAN sharing in mobile networks, which decouples network operators from radio resource by providing application-level services with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee. AppRAN defines a serial of abstract applications with distinct QoS requirements and periodically computes application-level resource allocation for each radio element at a central controller w.r.t. traffic demands and average channel condition. The radio elements are allowed to independently determine flow-level resource allocation within each application afterwards. We formulate the application-level resource allocation as an optimization problem and develop a fast algorithm to solve it with a provably approximate guarantee.

EC5,Efficient Network Sharing With Asymmetric Constraint Information,2019,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,M. Zhang; J. Huang,37,8,1898,1910,"Network sharing has become a key feature of various enablers of the next-generation network, such as network function virtualization and fog computing architectures. Network utility maximization (NUM) is a general framework for achieving fair, efficient, and cost-effective sharing of constrained network resources. When agents have asymmetric and private information, however, a fundamental economic challenge is how to solve the NUM problem considering the self-interests of strategic agents. Many previous related works have proposed economic mechanisms that can cope with agents' private utilities. However, the network sharing paradigm introduces the issue of information asymmetries regarding constraints. The related literature largely neglected such an issue; limited closely related studies provided solutions only applicable to specific application scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose the Decomposable NUM (DeNUM) mechanism and the Dynamic DeNUM (DyDeNUM) mechanism, the first mechanisms in the literature for solving NUM problems considering private utility and constraint information. The key idea of both mechanisms is to decentralize the decision process to agents, who will make resource allocation decisions without the need of revealing private information to others. Under a monitorable influence assumption, the DeNUM mechanism yields the network-utility maximizing solution at an equilibrium and achieves other desirable economic properties (such as individual rationality and budget balance). We further establish the connection between the equilibrium structure and the primal-dual solution to a related optimization problem, based on which we prove the convergence of the DeNUM algorithm to an equilibrium. When the agents' influences are not monitorable, we propose the DyDeNUM mechanism that yields the network-utility maximizing solution at the cost of the balanced budget. Finally, as a case study, we apply the proposed mechanisms to solving the NUM problem for a fog-based user-provided network and show that both mechanisms improve the network utility by 34% compared to a non-cooperation benchmark.",10.1109/JSAC.2019.2927136,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756278,Mechanism design;network sharing;network utility maximization;asymmetric constraint information;network economics,Resource management;Optimization;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Economics;Virtualization;5G mobile communication,2,47,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the previous VNRs may overconsume the critical substrate resources and lead to the resource fragmentation problem in the substrate networks, thus reducing the acceptance ratio of the latter VNRs. To address this problem, we propose a novel collaborative VNE algorithm based on resource importance measures, RIM-ViNE, in which the global node importance and link importance in the initial substrate network are measured using multiple topological attributes and are used to set the embedding cost of VNRs. Then, the VNE problem is defined as a linear programming model and is solved by minimizing the total embedding cost, which could bring about the coordinative embedding between different VNRs, and thus preventing the critical resources from being over occupied by the previous VNRs with small requirements and improving the resource fragmentation problem. Moreover, we propose a dynamic reconfiguration mechanism based on critical nodes protection (CNP-Re) to improve the resource fragmentation problem further. Extensive experiments are conducted under two network scenarios, and the results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the VNE algorithms that only consider the coordination between node mapping and link mapping or only measure the node importance in the residual substrate network, and the average VNR acceptance ratio, average revenue, and average resource utilization ratio are effectively improved.",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2861990,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424147,Coordinative virtual network embedding;dynamic reconfiguration;resource fragmentation;resource importance measure;topological attributes,Substrates;Heuristic algorithms;Resource management;Collaboration;Linear programming;Dynamic scheduling;Network topology,2,24,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the IMS-aware cloud point of view, a new Virtual Machine (VM) placement algorithm is presented that considers the structure of IMS elements and the links among them.

The model has two main components: estimation and allocation of the available resources. In the former, a technique for obtaining probability functions for the network throughput based on the available radio resources is introduced; in addition, three approaches for estimating the network capacity, other than a general one, are proposed, i.e., optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic. In the latter, a portion of the estimated network capacity is allocated to each of the services of Virtual Network Operators (VNOs). Meeting the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in addition to increasing the efficiency of resource usage are the key objectives in resource allocation. The results for practical scenarios show that the cellular network capacity can vary from 0.9 Gbps in the pessimistic approach up to 5.5 Gbps in the optimistic one. Moreover, the effect of this capacity variation on the allocation of the virtual radio resources to the VNOs with different SLAs is also studied. Finally, the isolation of the service classes and the VNOs by means of virtualisation of radio resources are clearly demonstrated through numeric results.",10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7391171,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7391171,,Resource management;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Estimation;Capacity planning;Rats;Linear programming,3,15,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a practical challenge is that the bandwidth utilization or traffic demand matrix is not always known before the deployment of an instance. A promising remedy is to leverage existing Software Defined Networking (SDN) policies to derive connectivity weights between components.

In this paper, we propose an energy efficient virtual network embedding (EEVNE) approach for cloud computing networks, where power savings are introduced by consolidating resources in the network and data centers. We model our approach in an IP over WDM network using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The performance of the EEVNE approach is compared with two approaches from the literature: the bandwidth cost approach (CostVNE) and the energy aware approach (VNE-EA). The CostVNE approach optimizes the use of available bandwidth, while the VNE-EA approach minimizes the power consumption by reducing the number of activated nodes and links without taking into account the granular power consumption of the data centers and the different network devices. The results show that the EEVNE model achieves a maximum power saving of 60% (average 20%) compared to the CostVNE model under an energy inefficient data center power profile. We develop a heuristic, real-time energy optimized VNE (REOViNE), with power savings approaching those of the EEVNE model. We also compare the different approaches adopting an energy efficient data center power profile. Furthermore, we study the impact of delay and node location constraints on the energy efficiency of virtual network embedding.

Lambadaris,14,4,890,903,"Network function virtualization along with network service chaining and forwarding graphs envision a reduction in the respective cost that end users, service providers, and network operators are experiencing, while providing complete and high quality services. The allocation of these service chains in a pool of available cloud or data center resources is a challenging problem that can affect the overall performance of the offered network services. Furthermore, a number of challenges associated with the hardware capabilities and the available resources of the cloud infrastructure, along with possible collocation constraints between the components of the service chain, can exponentially increase the complexity of resource allocation. This paper examines how to improve the overall allocation performance of deploying service chains in a cloud environment satisfying server affinity, collocation, and latency constraints.

These algorithms aim at embedding more and more requested virtual networks (VNs) onto the underlying networks and maximizing embedding revenues. Prior VNE algorithms mostly belong to the two-stage (separated node and link embedding) mapping algorithm category. Some other VNE algorithms embed each VN in one stage by using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach. There is a lack of one-stage heuristic algorithm, enabling to embed nodes and links in one mapping stage. In addition, each requested VN needs to be mapped in polynomial time so as to be promoted to future dynamic VN service application and real-time VNs embedding.

Today's optical networks are designed to carry large traffic aggregates with coarse-grained resource allocation, and are not adequate for maximizing utilization of the expensive optical substrate. Elastic Optical Network (EON) is an emerging technology that facilitates flexible allocation of fiber spectrum by leveraging finer-grained channel spacing, tunable modulation formats and Forward Error Correction (FEC) overheads, and baud-rate assignment, to right size spectrum allocation to customer needs. Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) over EON has been a recent topic of interest due to its importance for 5G network slicing. However, the problem has not yet been addressed while simultaneously considering the full flexibility offered by an EON. In this paper, we present an optimization model that solves the VNE problem over EON when lightpath configurations can be chosen among a large (and practical) set of combinations of paths, modulation formats, FEC overheads and baud rates. The VNE over EON problem is solved in its splittable version, which significantly increases problem complexity, but is much more likely to return a feasible solution. Given the intractability of the optimal solution, we propose a heuristic to solve larger problem instances. Key results from extensive simulations are: (i) a fully-flexible VNE can save up to 60% spectrum resources compared to that where no flexibility is exploited, and (ii) solutions of our heuristic fall in more than 90% of the cases, within 5% of the optimal solution, while executing several orders of magnitude faster.",10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737601,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8737601,,Modulation;Resource management;Substrates;Optical fiber networks;Forward error correction;Bandwidth;Wavelength division multiplexing,2,22,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laki,,,1,7,"Network QoS, fairness and resource sharing control are open challenges of network slicing and virtualization in 5G and future networks providing ultra-high speed Internet access. Traditional stateful solutions either employ the one-size-fits-all approach to provide services to end-users, regardless of the requirements of vertical services, or require real-time network monitoring and complex feedback loops for ensuring appropriate resource allocation at any time. In the past years, different core-stateless resource sharing solutions as scalable alternatives to traditional stateful approaches have recently emerged for closed networking domains like access, enterprise and data center networks. In this paper, we extend the core-stateless Per Packet Value (PPV) framework with the support of resource sharing policies across multiple layers of virtualization where policies defined by both physical and virtual network operators should be taken into account at the same time. To this end, we propose a re-marking mechanism that re-calculates packet markings during the transition from one virtualization layer to another, ensuring the desired resource sharing among end-users, network slices and physical networks without the need of real-time monitoring and complex feedback loops in the network core. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first core-stateless proposal that offers resource sharing for multiple layers of virtualization.",10.1109/ICC.2019.8761720,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761720,,Logic gates;Temperature measurement;Radio frequency;Data mining;Data models;Capacitance;Electrical resistance measurement,,17,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schmid; I. Vaishnavi; A. Khan; A. Feldmann,,,1,7,"The concept of CloudNets, virtual networks connecting cloud resources, has recently attracted much interest from both academic as well as business sides. CloudNets can realize the vision of affordable customized infrastructures. In particular, such networks are expected to be offered even in federated environments with multiple providers. Inter-provider communication about requirements or provisioning of truly customized virtual environments however require a powerful flexible resource description language (RDL). While extensibility and expressiveness seem to be natural requirements for such a language, we identify another less intuitive requirement affecting all actors (or stakeholders) in their economic benefits: the possibility to omit arbitrary specification details and to remain vague while at the same time describing real world scenarios. Not only may a description language ignoring this constraint easily become too bulky to use, it is also likely to force players to focus on details they are not interested in or lack the knowledge to map their actual requirements to. This paper identifies detailed requirements for an RDL to allow for topology and requirement communication in business scenarios.

Yang,,,1,7,"Network virtualization (NV) is one important attribute of the next generation network (e.g, upcoming 5G virtualized networking). Virtual network embedding (VNE) is about the resource allocation problem in NV. Multiple VNE algorithms have been proposed over the past decade. Prior algorithms focus on accepting more virtual networks (VNs) in one shared substrate network (SN) in order to maximize the embedding revenue. As energy cost is approaching half of the SN operating cost, it is crucial for infrastructure providers to minimize energy cost. In addition, in real networking environment, it is vital to embed each VN among multiple SNs, geographically distributed in different regions. To address both issues, we firstly propose the formal VNE problem model and VNE energy cost model. Then an energy efficient heuristic algorithm (EEMD-VNE) is detailed, aiming at maximizing the net profit. Meanwhile, the EEMD-VNE is able to embed each requested VN among multiple SNs in polynomial time. Numerical simulation results reveal that the EEMD-VNE significantly reduces the energy cost by approximately 8.5% over the existing energy related algorithms for accommodating the same amount of VNs.",10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644500,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644500,5G virtualized networking;virtual network embedding;energy cost;multiple substrate networks;heuristic algorithm,Substrates;Manganese;Bandwidth;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Approximation algorithms;Numerical models,,35,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC2,A Reliable Embedding Framework for Elastic Virtualized Services in the Cloud,2016,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,S. Ayoubi; Y. Zhang; C. Assi,13,3,489,503,"This paper proposes a novel framework for managing the resource provisioning of reliable virtual networks (VN) in the cloud. This includes handling the placement of VN requests while providing availability guarantees, as well as reconfiguring/adapting their placement as their request changes over time. This is particularly interesting for services with periodic resource demands. Given the heterogeneous failure rates of physical network components, the placement and reconfiguration must ensure that the selected hosts for each VN meets its availability requirements. The existing work on availability-aware VN placement has overlooked the case of “availability over-provisioning,” as well as the fact that VN requests are subject to change over time. To this extent, we propose a novel framework that consists of two main modules; JENA: a tabu-based availability-aware resource allocation (embedding) module for VNs that achieves “just-enough” availability guarantees, and ARES: a reliable reconfiguration module to adapt the embedding of hosted services as they scale. Further, we introduce the concept of “protection-domains” and “protection-policies” to equip our proposed modules with the ability to augment services with redundant/backup nodes to enhance their reliability. Our numerical results show that our framework enhances network's admissibility (with 33% lower blocking compared to existing work), and in return increases the cloud provider's long term revenue, compared to peer and benchmark algorithms.",10.1109/TNSM.2016.2581484,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492600,Cloud computing;virtualization;availability;elasticity,Cloud computing;Reliability;Servers;Peer-to-peer computing;Resource management;Virtualization;Hardware,9,48,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This provides some level of isolation and higher security. However, the use of groups may lead to fragmentation and negatively affect resource utilization.

A rather unexplored solution spectrum is to augment the VN with sufficient spare backup capacity to survive substrate failures and embed the resulting VN accordingly. Such augmentation enables InPs to offload failure recovery decisions to the VN operator, thus, providing more flexible VN management. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing spare backup capacity allocation in a VN and embedding the VN to guarantee full bandwidth in the presence of single substrate link failure.

Aadil,7,,46646,46658,"SDN and NFV are collaboratively recognized as the most promising bearing for flexible programmability of network control functions and protocols with dynamic usage of network resources. SDN provides the abstraction of network resources over well-defined APIs to achieve underlying topology-independent multiple tenant networks with required QoS and SLAs. NFV paradigm deploys network functions as software instances, namely, VNFs on commodity hardware using virtualization techniques. In this way, virtual IP functions, such as load balancing, routing, and forwarding or firewall, can operate as VNF in a cloud with a positive outcome in network performance. In this paper, we aimed to achieve traffic load balancing by using a virtual SDN (vSDN) controller as a VNF. With vSDN, when there is uneven and increased load, secondary vSDN controllers can be added to share this load. The need of secondary vSDN is determined and a copy vSDN with exactly the same configurations as original vSDN is created, which operates accurately and shares traffic load balancing tasks with an original vSDN controller. Both vSDN controllers are independently placed in the cloud with transparency assuring that every client in the network is familiar with the existence of the newly created secondary vSDN controller.

A selection algorithm is designed to proactively choose the virtual switches (vSWs) that should be migrated to other substrate switches for balancing TCAM utilization, i.e., solving what to reconfigure. Then, for the problem of how to reconfigure, i.e., where to re-map the selected vSWs and the virtual links connecting to them, we formulate a mixed integer linear programming model to solve it exactly, and design two heuristics to improve time efficiency. Next, we move to the system part, implement the proposed algorithms in our protocol-oblivious forwarding enabled network virtualization hypervisor system, and conduct experiments to demonstrate proactive and hitless vSDN reconfiguration.

Meanwhile, the platform allows the incumbent operators to operate a virtual instance of the bandwidth scheduling algorithm that enables them to meet their quality of service and latency requirements. Therefore, the proposed sharing platform grants a high degree of control to the operators co-operating the same network while, thanks to the higher resource efficiency, reduces the initial investment. We first model the multi-tenant PON as a market and define the roles of the virtual network operators and the infrastructure provider along with their utility functions.

In this context, simulator-based approaches are helpful for planning and evaluating the deployment of the cloud data center networking, but existing cloud simulators have several limitations: they have too high overhead for wide-scale data center networks, complex configuration, and too abstract deployment models.

The proposed solution not only makes configuration easier, but through extensive tests, we show that its execution overhead is limited to less than 130 MB of memory and the execution time is acceptable even for very wide-scale and complex deployment environments.",10.1109/JSAC.2019.2927066,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758131,Network simulation;data center network;software-defined networks;network functions virtualization;cloud computing;infrastructure as a service;Ns-2,Cloud computing;Data centers;Network topology;Computational modeling;Topology;Green products;Data models,,32,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tran; S. M. A. Kazmi; C. S. Hong,,,429,434,"The successful virtualization of wireless access networks is strongly affected by the way in which radio resources are managed. The infrastructure provider (InP) is required to deploy efficient and flexible resource allocation techniques to dynamically allocate the resources for the users associated with different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). Service contracts with different MVNOs and fairness among their users are crucial to the success of the virtualization scheme deployed by the InP. In this paper, a game-theoretic framework is proposed for resource allocation in OFDMA virtualized wireless network. The framework considers a market model consisting an InP and multiple MVNOs. Regarding the virtual resource for a virtualized wireless network as commodities, the InP wants to maximize its revenue by leasing the infrastructure to the MVNOs while meeting certain contract agreements. Moreover, MVNOs want to serve their users at the best performance and want to pay the minimum to InP. A two-stage Stackelberg game is applied to optimize the strategies of both the InP (the leader) and MVNOs (the followers).

Meddeb,,,55,62,"Network Virtualization allows overcoming the limitations of the current Internet. It enables the embedding of virtual networks on physical ones. Service providers share the same physical infrastructure in order to provide their own services and deploy their new ones. The allocation of available physical resources is an important issue for Network Virtualization. Due to the hardness of this problem, many heuristics are proposed to simplify its resolution. In this paper, we present two novel heuristics for physical resource allocation which are Traffic Concentration and Load Sharing. With Traffic Concentration heuristic, service providers concentrate all the traffic on the shortest path. However, with Load Sharing heuristic, they share the load on multiple paths. We compare the performances of these heuristics in terms of latency, jitter, packet loss ratio, connection to server probability, node and link utilization, throughput and leased bandwidth as a function of the number of used servers. Simulation results demonstrate that the choice of resource utilization has an impact on the performance: with Traffic Concentration, we gain in terms of cost of leased bandwidth and jitter.

Ogawa; G. Hasegawa; M. Murata,,,555,562,"In a multitenant data center, nodes and links of tenants' virtual networks (VNs) share a single component of the physical substrate network (SN). A failure of the single SN component can thereby cause simultaneous failures of multiple nodes and links in a VN, this complex of failures must significantly disrupt the services offered on the VN. In the present paper, we clarify how the fault tolerance of a VN is affected by a SN failure, especially from the perspective of VN allocation in the SN. We propose a VN allocation model for multitenant data centers and formulate a problem that deals with the bandwidth loss in the VN due the SN failure. We conduct numerical simulations with the setting that has 1.7 × 108 bit/s bandwidth demand on each VN. The results show that the bandwidth loss can be reduced to 5.3 × 102 bit/s per VN, but the required bandwidth between physical servers in the SN increases to 1.0 × 109 bit/s per VN when each node in the VN is mapped to an individual physical server. The balance between the bandwidth loss and the required bandwidth between physical servers can be optimized by assigning every four nodes of the VN to each physical server, meaning that we minimize the bandwidth loss without providing too sufficient bandwidth in the core area of the SN.",10.1109/CloudCom.2014.64,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037716,data center;multitenant;virtual network allocation;multiple simultaneous failures;fault tolerance,Servers;Tin;Bandwidth;Resource management;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Complexity theory,1,28,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bao,9,2,427,441,"A cloud computing paradigm enables users to access services, applications, and infrastructure resources by using thin clients anywhere and at any time. In this paradigm, multiple users can share cloud infrastructure resources. The application or service requests from a user can be abstracted as a virtual network (VN) request and can be submitted to the cloud-based data centers. How to map a VN onto the cloud infrastructure network is a challenging issue in cloud resource provisioning. Thus, efficient mapping techniques that intelligently use the resources of cloud infrastructure are important and necessary. Current research on VN mapping and design focuses on resource-efficient VN mapping or cost-efficient VN mapping. However, there is another important issue in cloud-based data centers that we must pay attention to, i.e., the amount of power or energy that is consumed by a data center. The power consumption in data centers can be a significant percentage of the total power consumption, and it not only leads to a higher data center operating cost but also contributes to carbon emissions and the greenhouse effect. In this paper, we propose a power-efficient resource provisioning technique in cloud-based data centers while complying with service level agreements. We first model a power-efficient VN provisioning problem as a mathematical optimization problem, with the objective of minimizing the power consumption by employing mixed-integer programming. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve this model since this optimization problem is NP-hard.

Embedding algorithms based on Oktopus model were well studied in the single-root tree topology. In this paper, we investigate congestion-aware allocation of virtual data centers in multipath networks. First, we formulate bandwidth constraints with linear programming, and provide a complete solution with exhaustive searching. Next, to reduce time complexity, we propose a perturbation algorithm to VM placement, which detects the bandwidth bottleneck of the current virtual machine placement and then adjusts the assignment to reduce congestion. The perturbation algorithm is compatible with both load-balanced and single-path routing algorithms. We compare the performance of the exhaustive searching algorithm and perturbation algorithm with load-balanced or single-path routing by simulations. The perturbation algorithm with load-balanced routing performs close to the exhaustive searching algorithm while significantly reduces the time complexity.

However, a domain-level view is required to achieve quality of service (QoS)-aware VN mapping across multiple domains.

In the framework, the VN mapping is accomplished by the mapping manager that is the broker between the SPs and the InPs. The mapping manager collects the mapping candidates for the VN request from the InPs, and then establishes the abstracted domain-level graph. Finally the candidates are selected on the domain-level graph with QoS consideration.

Ruffini,,,1,6,"The worldwide installation of Fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) access network solutions is hindered by the high upfront cost of deploying ubiquitous fiber infrastructure. While passive optical networks can provide lower cost compared to point-to-point solutions, their total cost of ownership is still high for most operators to justify a mass scale deployment. Sharing passive optical network (PON) infrastructure has thus been proposed as a solution for network operators to reduce the cost of running FTTP services. In addition, the ability for operators to offer business services (including for example mobile backhaul) in addition to residential services, is crucial to increase the overall PON network revenue. However running services with highly diverse requirements over a physical infrastructure shared among multiple operators (which we now refer to as virtual network operators -VNOs) requires VNOs to have a tight control over PON capacity scheduling. In this paper, we introduce a novel upstream PON capacity sharing algorithm called Frame Level Sharing (FLS).

On this basis, we further analyze newly arising challenges and discuss future research directions by presenting a cross-layer protocol stack. Finally, for the proof of concept, we implement the system prototype and give two case studies in real-world IoV environments. The results of field tests not only demonstrate the great potential of the new architecture, but also give insight into the development of future ITS.",10.1109/MCOM.2019.1800772,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767077,,Computer architecture;Edge computing;Vehicle dynamics;Intelligent vehicles;Wireless communication;Information services;Cloud computing,1,15,IEEE Magazines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qiu,6,,33201,33215,"Network virtualization is becoming one of the most promising ways to solve resource solidification problem of fiber-wireless access networks. To fully utilize substrate resources, a virtual resource embedding method including three sub-mechanisms is presented in this paper. The first one is the priority-based virtual network request (VNR) selecting mechanism, which sorts VNRs and preferentially selects higher priority VNRs for embedding. Then a dynamic embedding mechanism based on load balancing is presented to increase the acceptance rate of VNRs. Second, when embedding is saturated, an embedding update mechanism is proposed to deal with the arrival of new VNRs. It promotes the acceptance rate of high-priority VNRs and the revenue of the infrastructure provider (InP). Finally, a backup resource sharing mechanism is designed to improve reliability, which enables backup resources to be shared and responds to the failures with minimal resources. The simulation results show that the proposed embedding method can balance the resource consumption better than the Greedy Node Embedding and Shortest-path Link Embedding Algorithm, as well as the Greedy Node Embedding and Maximum Residual Bandwidth Link Embedding Algorithm.

Li,4,,416,424,"In smart cities, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) act as a type of core infrastructure that collects data from the city to implement smart services. The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected.

This is known as the survivable VN embedding (SVNE) problem. The state-of-the-art literature has studied the SVNE problem from infrastructure providers' (InPs') perspective, i.e., provisioning backup resources in the SN. A rather unexplored solution spectrum is to augment the VN with sufficient spare backup capacity to survive substrate failures and embed the resulting VN accordingly. Such augmentation enables InPs to offload failure recovery decisions to the VN operator, thus providing more flexible VN management. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing spare capacity allocation in a VN and embedding the VN to guarantee full bandwidth in the presence of multiple substrate link failures. We formulate the optimal solution to this problem as a quadratic integer program that we transform into an integer linear program. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to solve larger instances of the problem. Based on analytical study and simulation, our key findings are: 1) provisioning shared backup resources in the VN can yield ~33% more resource efficient embedding compared to doing the same at the SN level and 2) our heuristic allocates ~21% extra resources compared to the optimal, while executing several orders of magnitude faster.",10.1109/JSAC.2018.2815430,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8314665,Network virtualization;survivability;virtual network embedding;spare capacity;joint optimization,Substrates;Resource management;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Optimization;Virtualization;Electronic mail,5,52,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EC4,Efficient Modeling and Demand Allocation for Differentiated Cloud Virtual-Network as-a Service Offerings,2016,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,B. Wanis; N. Samaan; A. Karmouch,4,4,376,391,"Cloud clients (CCs) of current distributed cloud applications are still not assured of their service quality, in particular, in terms of the experienced latency. Unfortunately, this is mainly attributed to the unpredictability of the communication links among their hosting distributed data centers. To address this problem, this article introduces a novel virtual-network-as-a-service (VNaaS) model to host these applications. In contrast to existing randomly or statically provisioned inter-data centers bandwidth sharing models, the proposed model allows CCs to accurately express their varying network resources needs, demand constraints and tolerance to the cloud latency. In turn, the model maps these requirements to create inter-data centers virtual links hosting each multiple virtual pipes with differentiated service qualities to carry the CC's various traffic flows. To aid the CCs in optimally determining their VNaaS demands, given the budget constraints of their hosted applications, we also develop a novel demand selection scheme based on a two stage-budget allocation mechanism. In the first budgeting stage, the CC calculates an optimal effective service rate for each of its virtual link along with a corresponding link budget and price index. In the second stage, the virtual link budget is distributed to purchase bandwidth for the link's virtual pipes, each with a given service quality and pricing. We then extend the proposed model to allow the CC to enforce any required virtual links' capacity constraints on the effective service rates resulting from the traffic matrix on the VNaaS. Finally, we develop corresponding differentiated VNaaS pricing and service monitoring mechanisms that can be employed by the cloud service provider (CSP) to regulate the offerings and demands of the distributed cloud services.

This is a concept known as dynamic slicing. This paper presents a solution for the dynamic slicing problem in terms of both mixed integer linear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms. The benefits of dynamic slicing are compared against static slicing, i.e., an approach without intelligent adaptation of the amount of resources allocated to each VN. Simulation results show that dynamic slicing can reduce the VN rejection probability by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to static slicing. This can help network providers accept more VNs into their infrastructure and potentially increase their revenues.

Ma,7,,134145,134157,"The great success of the Internet has promoted the development of digital industries and increased the demand for communication bandwidth. For example, ultrahigh-definition videos and vehicle networks require fast bandwidth speed and increase network connection density, respectively. High-bandwidth and high-density parallel communication drive the rapid development of network virtualization and 5G/6G technology. In a network virtualization environment, this new demand also brings new link resource allocation difficulties in existing substrate networks. To solve this far-reaching problem, this paper proposes a virtual network embedding algorithm via diffusion wavelet (VNE_DW), which is an unsupervised structure learning algorithm. Through the diffusion wavelet, the topology structure of nodes, connection density, and link volume among the nodes are comprehensively evaluated. Nodes that facilitate the link mapping success rate are preferentially selected. Experimental results demonstrate that the mapping success rate and revenue-cost ratio of VNE_DW outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms with high bandwidth and density.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940971,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835914,Virtual network embedding;diffusion wavelet;topology structure;link bandwidth;connection density,Substrates;Topology;Machine learning algorithms;Network topology;Bandwidth;Heuristic algorithms;Virtualization,,39,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC2,Cost-Efficient Mapping for Fault-Tolerant Virtual Networks,2015,IEEE Transactions on Computers,A. Jarray; A. Karmouch,64,3,668,681,"Network virtualization provides more flexibility in network provisioning as it offers physical infrastructure providers (PIP) the possibility of smoothly rolling out many separate networks on top of an existing infrastructure. A major challenge is the embedding problem of mapping virtual networks (VNs) onto PIP infrastructure. In the literature, a good deal of research has focused on providing heuristic approaches to this NP-hard problem, usually with the assumption that the PIP infrastructure is operational at all times. In virtualization environment, a single physical node/link failure can result in one or more logical link failures as it effects all VNs with a mapping that spans over. Setting up a dedicated backup for each VN embedding that is not shared with others is an inefficient use of resources. To address these concerns, this paper proposes two classes of periodic VN protection against link and node failures: (a) in the physical layer, by using a path or segment p-cycle technique and a column generation optimization model, and (b) in the VN layer, by augmenting the topology with redundant resources and subsequently applying a column generation mapping model.

An extensive body of work exists on SFC orchestration, although a vast majority of them consider reactive algorithms that reprovision resources in response to service demand fluctuations. As such, they result in unpredictable and often significant delays that negatively affect the performance of delay-sensitive SFCs. In this paper, we consider proactive SFC orchestration and develop exact and approximate algorithms that perform well under general service demands without requiring frequent resource reprovisioning. Specifically, we first formulate SFC orchestration with deadline as a mixed integer non-linear program and show that it can be reduced to a second-order cone program, which can be solved using standard optimization software, albeit for small problem instances. We then design an approximate algorithm for large problem instances by applying iterative rounding and variable fixing techniques to the exact problem formulation.

García,7,,151948,151961,"An important concern that 5G networks face is supporting a wide range of services and use cases with heterogeneous requirements. Radio access network (RAN) slices, understood as isolated virtual networks that share a common infrastructure, are a possible answer to this very demanding scenario and enable virtual operators to provide differentiated services over independent logical entities. This article addresses the feasibility of forming 5G slices, answering the question of whether the available capacity (resources) is sufficient to satisfy slice requirements. As spectral efficiency is one of the key metrics in 5G networks, we introduce the minislot-based slicing allocation (MISA) model, a novel 5G slice resource allocation approach that combines the utilization of both complete slots (or physical resource blocks) and mini-slots with the adequate physical layer design and service requirement constraints. We advocate for a probabilistic characterization that allows to estimate feasibility and characterize the behavior of the constraints, while an exhaustive search is very computationally demanding and the methods to check feasibility provide no information on the constraints. In such a characterization, the concept of phase transition allows for the identification of a clear frontier between the feasible and infeasible regions. Our method relies on an adaptation of the Wang-Landau algorithm to determine the existence of, at least, one solution to the problem. The conducted simulations show a significant improvement in spectral efficiency and feasibility of the MISA approach compared to the slot-based formulation, the identification of the phase transition, and valuable results to characterize the satisfiability of the constraints.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947992,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873556,5G slice;resource allocation;feasibility;phase transition;Wang-Landau algorithm,Resource management;5G mobile communication;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Probabilistic logic;Optimization,,83,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EC5,Maximizing Infrastructure Providers’ Revenue Through Network Slicing in 5G,2019,IEEE Access,M. Vincenzi; E. Lopez-Aguilera; E. Garcia-Villegas,7,,128283,128297,"Adapting to recent trends in mobile communications towards 5G, infrastructure owners are gradually modifying their systems for supporting the network programmability paradigm and for participating in the slice market (i.e., dynamic leasing of virtual network slices to service providers). Two-fold are the advantages offered by this upgrade: i) enabling next generation services, and ii) allowing new profit opportunities. Many efforts exist already in the field of admission control, resource allocation and pricing for virtualized networks. Most of the 5G-related research efforts focus in technological enhancements for making existing solutions compliant to the strict requirements of next generation networks. On the other hand, the profit opportunities associated to the slice market also need to be reconsidered in order to assess the feasibility of this new business model. Nonetheless, when economic aspects are studied in the literature, technical constraints are generally oversimplified. For this reason, in this work, we propose an admission control mechanism for network slicing that respects 5G timeliness while maximizing network infrastructure providers' revenue, reducing expenditures and providing a fair slice provision to competing service providers. To this aim, we design an admission policy of reduced complexity based on bid selection, we study the optimal strategy in different circumstances (i.e., pool size of available resources, service providers' strategy and traffic load), analyze the performance metrics and compare the proposal against reference approaches. Finally, we explore the case where infrastructure providers lease network slices either on-demand or on a periodic time basis and provide a performance comparison between the two approaches.

However, the potential price to be paid for facilitating network slicing in a multi-tenant virtual network is the underutilization of the scarce wireless network resources due to the different tenant requirements and the inherent dynamics of the traffic. A potential way to avoid such sacrifice of radio resources is to allow efficient inter-tenant resource sharing. To this end, this paper proposes a novel optimization framework for flexible inter-tenant resource sharing embedded with transmission power control to aggressively improve network capacity, the utilization of wireless access resources, user data rate as well as energy efficiency. More specifically, we define two novel resource sharing mechanisms called tight coupling and loose coupling, respectively, via mixed integer linear programming formulations. Furthermore, two resource and power joint allocation algorithms are designed to solve the optimization problem in polynomial time.

Specifically, the cloud RAN (C-RAN) architecture has shown that it can alleviate to some extent the ever-increasing total cost of ownership in mobile networks. The current trend in C-RAN is to separate remote radio heads with radio frequency (RF) functions and baseband unit (BBU) gathering baseband processing. This functional split allows the RF modules to be kept close to the antennas while placing BBUs at centralized locations so they can be shared among different sites and even be virtualized. However, some issues still need to be addressed in future mobile networks, especially due to the dynamicity of services and the strict constraints imposed by the interfaces needed.

Specifically, our approach is based on the following designs: 1. A novel way for capacity cumulation based on temporal and spatial diversity of network content/service access: there always exists redundant resources and ability among other sensors in time and spatial domain that can be piled up as a considerable amount, though each piece may be really small; 2.

An important part of virtual network management consists in migrating them in order to optimize resource allocation and react to link failures. However, the migration process might entail the loss of security properties in the virtual network, such as confidentiality. In this paper, we present the first approach combining formal models and virtualization to prove confidentiality preservation during the migration process. We describe the network environment, the migration process and the confidentiality with a set of logical predicates that will be used by SNARK to obtain the formal proof of the preservation.

Li,,,1823,1828,"Survivable virtual network embedding (SVNE) aims at embedding a virtual network (VN) in a way, that after being affected by substrate failures, the VN is still operating. Based on the single node failure assumption, that at any time there can be at most one failed substrate node, the existing studies for the SVNE against substrate node failures back up VNs with a maximum resource sharing. However, multiple node failures do happen in reality, thus those methods are not always effective. In this paper, we propose a topology-aware VN embedding approach to enhancing the survivability against multiple node failures. We make use of the topology attributes to provide each substrate node with multiple potential failover choices, based on which a recoverability-based VN embedding algorithm and a profit-driven VN remapping algorithm are presented.

The objective of the MVNO is to maximize its profit while guaranteeing the backhaul constraint and users' QoS by jointly allocating the slices and the uplink transmit power to the users. To solve the formulated mixed integer non-convex problem, we propose a distributed solution framework based on Lagrangian relaxation to a find suboptimal decision about slice and transmit power allocations.

Figueiredo; K. Ichikawa,,,186,193,"Since the Internet is an aggregation of multiple ASes (Autonomous Systems), congestion control and utilization are not globally optimized. For example, it is not uncommon that a direct shortest route with low latency delivers less bandwidth than an alternative, long and roundabout route. Previous research has shown that geospatially distributed computing instances in commercial clouds offer users an opportunity to deploy relay points to detour potentially congested ASes, and as a means to diversify paths to increase overall bandwidth and reliability. Such opportunity comes with a cost, as cloud-routed paths incur cost of not only provisioning of computing resources, but also for additional traffic to/from Internet. Well-established protocols, such as TCP, were created based on assumption of single end-point to end-point transfer; nonetheless, current computing devices have multiple end-points, and the increasing availability of overlay networks allows multiplexing multiple virtual network flows into a single physical network interface. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the extent to which using cloud paths to transfer data in parallel with the default Internet path can improve the end-to-end bandwidth in bulk data transfers. In our evaluation, we consider single-stream and multi-stream TCP transfers across one or more paths.

It fosters network innovation, rapid time to market for emerging networking concepts and enables cohabitation of different virtual networks with customized network protocols on the same physical infrastructure. It can also alleviate the ossification problem of radio spectrum that has been a major concern for telecommunication operators. Virtualization is also a key enabler for green communications as it not only reduces energy consumption by ensuring efficient use of hardware resources through resource sharing but also facilitates use of renewable energy sources for the communications infrastructure. This paper presents two different types of frameworks to classify wireless network virtualization design alternatives. The benefits of virtual wireless networks are very often expected from a cost perspective. Yet provisioning of stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements calls for a thorough analysis especially from PHY & MAC layers perspectives. A method for selecting the most efficient network architecture has been proposed that takes into account both network operators' (and/or service providers') cost and QoS constraints.

Zhang; X. Lu; D. K. Panda,,,143,152,"High-speed interconnects (e.g. InfiniBand) have been widely deployed on modern HPC clusters. With the emergence of HPC in the cloud, high-speed interconnects have paved their way into the cloud with recently introduced Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) technology, which is able to provide efficient sharing of high-speed interconnect resources and achieve near-native I/O performance. However, recent studies have shown that SR-IOV-based virtual networks prevent virtual machine migration, which is an essential virtualization capability towards high availability and resource provisioning. Although several initial solutions have been pro- posed in the literature to solve this problem, our investigations show that there are still many restrictions on these proposed approaches, such as depending on specific network adapters and/or hypervisors, which will limit the usage scope of these solutions on HPC environments. In this paper, we propose a high-performance virtual machine migration framework for MPI applications on SR-IOV enabled InfiniBand clusters. Our proposed method does not need any modification to the hypervisor and InfiniBand drivers and it can efficiently handle virtual machine (VM) migration with SR-IOV IB device. Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed design is able to not only achieve fast VM migration speed but also guarantee the high performance for MPI applications during the migration in the HPC cloud. At the application level, for NPB LU benchmark running inside VM, our proposed design is able to completely hide the migration overhead through the computation and migration overlapping.

In this paper, we present FOCUS, a general and scalable service which easily integrates into existing and emerging systems to provide this fundamental capability. FOCUS utilizes a gossip-based protocol for nodes to organize into groups based on attributes and current value. With this approach, nodes need not synchronize with a central database, and instead the FOCUS service only needs to query the sub-set of nodes which have the potential to positively match a given query. We show FOCUS's flexibility through an operational example of complex querying for Virtual Network Functions instantiation over cloud sites, and illustrate its ease of integration by replacing the push-based approach in OpenStack's placement service.

Multi-network access (MNA), where a cell phone can use any one of multiple MNOs at any point in space and time, can greatly increase cellular network capacity. This paper investigates how much MNA can improve cellular network capacity in the context of a multi-operator mobile virtual network operator (MO-MVNO), such as Google's Project Fi, and explores how the capacity gain varies with the MNOs' resource allocation scheme, and the MO-MVNO's market share and MNO selection algorithm.

Chaczko,PP,99,1,14,"Network virtualization is an inherent component of future internet architectures. Network resources are virtualized from the underlying substrate and elastically provisioned and offered to customers on-demand. Optimal allocation of network resources in terms of utilization, quality of service, and energy consumption has been a challenge. Existing solutions consider congestion control in a single-objective virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. This paper defines a multiple-objective VNE problem called the congestion-aware, energy-aware VNE (CEVNE). The aim is to seek a solution that saves cost, saves energy and avoids network congestion simultaneously. CEVNE modelling techniques and solution approaches apply both the weighting method and the constraint method to search for pareto-optimal solutions that produce the best compromised solutions for all three objectives. Solving VNE problem is, however, NP-hard. A heuristic solution is proposed involving a two-stage coordinated CEVNE. The node-mapping algorithm searches for the sub-optimal solutions for three objectives. The link mapping process is an SDN-based heuristic algorithm that deploys a path service and a resource monitoring application on an SDN controller. The solution is realized using SDN, Segment Routing, and open network operating system platform (ONOS) technologies. The energy minimization is implemented with a registry that keeps track of active nodes and sets inactive nodes to sleep mode. The evaluation results showed that the multiple-objective CEVNE approach is feasible and achieves its goals of optimizing the resource allocation, improving the runtime, saving the energy consumption and controlling the network congestion.",10.1109/TNET.2019.2958367,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945162,Virtual network embedding;network virtualization;software-defined networks;segment routing;energy saving;congestion control;path services;multiple-objective optimization.,,,,IEEE Early Access Articles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, the available resources distributed among NSs are correlated and one needs to allocate them judiciously in order to guarantee the service, MNO, and overall system qualities. In this paper, we consider a joint resource allocation strategy that weights the significance of the resources per a given NS by leveraging the correlation structure of different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the services. After defining the joint resource allocation problem including the correlation structure, we propose three novel scheduling mechanisms that allocate available network resources to the generated NSs based on different type of services with different QoS requirements. Performance of the proposed schedulers are then investigated through Monte-Carlo simulations and compared with each other as well as against a traditional max-min fairness algorithm benchmark.

Although security and performance of cloud data centers have been well studied in the past, their networking aspects are overlooked. Current network infrastructures in cloud data centers limit the ability of cloud provider to offer guaranteed cloud network resources to users. In order to ensure security and performance requirements as defined in the service level agreement (SLA) between cloud user and provider, cloud providers need the ability to provision network resources dynamically and on the fly. The main challenge for cloud provider in utilizing network resource can be addressed by provisioning virtual networks that support information centric services by separating the control plane from the cloud infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an sdn based information centric cloud framework to provision network resources in order to support elastic demands of cloud applications depending on SLA requirements. The framework decouples the control plane and data plane wherein the conceptually centralized control plane controls and manages the fully distributed data plane.

Mukherjee,6,3,16,33,"In this article traffic-engineering issues regarding network survivability, traffic grooming, impairment-aware routing, virtual-topology engineering, and coordination among multiple layers of network architecture will be reviewed for next-generation optical networks based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Due to the recent progress and development of WDM technology, increasing traffic demands can be readily accommodated in the next-generation optical networks. In spite of the huge amount of capacity (e.g., OC-192) provided by a WDM channel, enhanced network services and network performance improvement can only be achieved with efficient traffic-engineering mechanisms. The fault-tolerant function is essential in order to provide seamless services to users by protecting their traffic against failures in the optical network because many connections can be carried on a fiber. Because the capacity of a WDM channel is very large, its bandwidth may not be efficiently utilized by a single connection. Hence, low-rate user connections need to be efficiently aggregated through the traffic-grooming scheme. An intelligent routing algorithm is especially necessary in the optical network where signal impairments due to device imperfections might degrade the signal quality. In addition, the virtual network connectivity (topology) should be flexibly maintained such that dynamic changes to the traffic demands can be easily absorbed, which can be implemented by the virtual-topology engineering method in a WDM network. As the dominant usage of Internet protocol (IP) of the Internet is expected to reside directly above the WDM layer in the future network, the coordinated traffic-engineering scheme should be deliberately designed for the multi-layer network by judiciously choosing where to put many overlapping functions in the different network layers.",10.1109/COMST.2004.5342291,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342291,,Telecommunication traffic;Next generation networking;Optical fiber networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;IP networks;Wavelength routing;Fault tolerance;Protection;Bandwidth,31,127,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wu; Z. Qu; H. Zhu; L. Yang,,,1,6,"Virtual network embedding (VNE) refers to the resource allocation problem for network virtualization. Since its inception, multiple mapping algorithms have been proposed for embedding virtual networks (VNs) effectively and efficiently. However, prior mapping algorithms mostly complete the VN embedding in two separated stages: first node embedding and subsequent link embedding. Certain mapping algorithms embed the VN in one stage by using mixed integer linear programming method or subgraph isomorphism approach, involving high embedding completion time. Meanwhile, prior researchers conduct the VN embedding, on the basis of one underlying substrate network (SN). While in future VNE application, each VN must be mapped among multiple geographically distributed SNs. On above backgrounds, we propose a location aware and node ranking value driven embedding algorithm, labeled as LANRVD. The LANRVD enables to conduct the embedding in two coordinated embedding stages within polynomial time. In addition, the LANRVD embeds the VN among multiple geographically distributed SNs.

Siracusa,,,1,7,"Network virtualization sits firmly on the Internet evolutionary path allowing researchers to experiment with novel clean-slate designs over the production network and practitioners to manage multi-tenants infrastructures in a flexible and scalable manner. In such scenarios, isolation between virtual networks is often intended as purely logical: this is the case of address space isolation or flow space isolation. This approach neglects the effect that network virtualization has on resource allocation network-wide. In this work we investigate the price paid by a purely logical approach in terms of performance degradation. This performance loss is paid by the actual users of a multi-tenants datacenter network. We propose a solution to this problem leveraging on a new network virtualization primitive, namely an online link utilization feedback mechanism. It provides each tenant with the necessary information to make efficient use of network resources. We evaluate our solution trough a real implementation exploiting the OpenFlow protocol.

In this work, a novel contract theoretic incentive mechanism is proposed to study how to manage the resources and provide services to the users in the wireless virtualized networks. We consider that the infrastructure providers (InPs) own the physical networks and the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) has the service information of the users and needs to lease the physical radio resources for providing services. In particular, we utilize the contract theoretic approach to model the resource trading process between the MVNO and multiple InPs. Two scenarios are considered according to whether the information (such as the radio resource they can provide) of the InPs are globally known. Subsequently, the corresponding optimal contracts regarding the user association and transmit power allocation are derived to maximize the payoff of the MVNOs while maintaining the requirements of the InPs in the trading process. To evaluate the proposed scheme, extensive simulation studies are conducted. It can be observed that the proposed contract theoretic approach can effectively stimulate InPs’ participation, improve the payoff of the MVNO, and outperform other schemes.",10.1109/TMC.2018.2889046,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585094,Wireless virtualized network;contract theory;resource allocation;power allocation;user association,Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Contracts;Resource management;Wireless networks;Virtualization,3,28,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such a context, this issue usually referred to as the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem, adds more complexity since the entire embedding process requires two mayor phases of operation: the multicloud virtual network requests (VNRs) splitting, followed by the intracloud VNR segments mapping. This paper focuses on the splitting phase problem, by proposing a VNRs splitting strategy formalized as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model, with the objective of improving the performance and QoS of resulting mapped VNR segments, while minimizing the resource provisioning expenditures. As the VNE is classified as an NP-hard problem, a hybrid metaheuristic approach based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) combined with the Tabu Search (TS) as local search operator, is proposed in order to find good feasible solutions in reasonable time.

Kapoor,27,9,2191,2204,"With multiple cores integrated on the same die, communication across cores is managed by on-chip interconnect called network-on-chip (NoC). Power and performance of these interconnect is a significant factor as the communication network consumes a considerable share of the power budget. In particular, the buffers used at every port of the NoC router consume considerable dynamic as well as static power. This paper attempts to reduce static power consumption by using non-volatile memory technology-based spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) buffers. STT-RAM technology has the advantage of high density and low leakage but suffers from weaker write endurance. This impacts the lifetime of the router as a whole. The buffers in a router are allocated to virtual networks (VNets) and in-turn to virtual channels (VCs) within each VNet. To reduce uneven writes across the buffers, we propose policies to reduce intra-VNet write variation and inter-VNet write variation. The former performs write variation aware VC allocation in each VNet, and the latter does write variation aware buffer assignments to each VNet. Experimental evaluation on full system simulator shows that proposed policies reduce write variation to almost 0% and improve lifetime by 3.3 and 19.9 times for intra-VNet and inter-VNet, respectively.

In WNV, the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) works as a controller to schedule the physical resources, e.g., communication, computing, and caching resources. However, due to the selfishness of the user, it may keep its expected quality of service (QoS) as private information, which is not known by the MVNO for lower price or higher QoS. Such asymmetric information will lead to inefficient resource allocation. To solve the aforementioned problems, we give the caching strategy and exploit contract theory to formulate the joint resource allocation problem under asymmetric information in wireless caching systems. Particularly, the MVNO acts as a principal designing contract items for the users who are classified into a finite number of types according to their expected QoS. Since nonlinear and the analytical result is infeasible to obtain, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is further proposed to find the optimized contract with low complexity.

White,7,11,4166,4175,"The high cost associated with the rollout of 3G services encourages operators to share network infrastructure. Network sharing poses a new challenge in devising fair and Pareto optimal resource allocation strategies to distribute system resources among users and operators in the network. Cooperative game theory provides a framework for formulating such strategies. In this paper, we propose two models (i.e. symmetric and asymmetric) for cooperative resource bargaining among the users and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) of each operator in shared networks based on the concept of preference functions. The bargaining solutions proposed vary according to a parameter beta that considers the tradeoff between one's gain and the losses of others. The well-known Nash and Raiffa- Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions are special instances of the solutions proposed. The symmetric model assumes that all players have equal bargaining powers while in the asymmetric case, players are allowed to submit bids to the network operator to influence the final bargaining outcome. Due to the diversity of demand patterns, temporary resource exchange among operators can provide benefits in terms of better communication quality to their users. To avoid selfish behaviour of the operators, we propose a resource sharing model that allocates extra resources based on the past allocations and contributions of each operator.",10.1109/T-WC.2008.06102,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4684593,Resource allocation;shared networks;game theory;Nash bargaining solution;Raiffa-Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution;revenue maximization,Resource management;Radio access networks;Game theory;Costs;Licenses;Australia;Investments;Acceleration;Multiaccess communication;Consumer electronics,34,25,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gomes; L. F. Bittencourt; E. R. M. Madeira; E. Cerqueira; M. Gerla,,,411,416,"Even after decades, the Internet does not provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee for the users. In order to soften such situation, clients negotiate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with their Internet Service Providers (ISPs), where reliability and available bandwidth are key requirements for Internet services. On the other hand, the ISPs aim to decrease the energy consumption to deliver their services and provide a green environment. The mixing of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) and Virtual Networks (VNs), called Virtual Software Defined Network (VSDN), arises as a realizable option to deal with both client and provider perspectives. Within this context, this paper proposes two algorithms to allocate VSDNs combining reliability, bandwidth, and energy efficiency, considering the current network state to adjust the importance of each of these aspects during the allocation process. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in allocating reliable VSDNs, while improving the energy efficiency and bandwidth usage of the ISP.",10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444815,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444815,Virtual Network;Software Defined Network;Reliability;Energy Efficiency;Bandwidth;Planning of Allocation,Resource management;Redundancy;Bandwidth;Software;Topology;Internet,3,11,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shirzad; M. Ghaderi,,,196,204,"This paper studies the network-wide spectrum sharing problem in virtual cellular networks applicable to Cloud Radio Access Network architecture. Virtual wireless networks share network resources such as time-frequency resources on the same physical infrastructure. A critical problem is then the allocation of shared physical resources to the virtual networks so that the utilization of the resources is maximized. We formulate the problem as a linear integer maximization problem, which is shown to be NP-hard. We then develop a polynomial time heuristic algorithm called Non-balancing Spectrum Sharing (NSS), which is guaranteed to achieve a solution whose resource utilization approaches half of that of the optimal solution in the worst-case. Two additional heuristic algorithms are also proposed to improve the worst-case performance of NSS by enabling load balancing among adjacent base stations.

The simulation results confirm that i) NSS performs remarkably close to the optimal algorithm, and ii) the two other heuristic algorithms outperform NSS, and consequently are even closer to the optimal algorithm in the simulated scenarios.",10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.67,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774581,Virtualization;Spectrum Sharing;Wireless Network Embedding;Virtual Resource Allocation;Cloud Radio Access Networks;Cellular Networks,Resource management;Virtualization;Base stations;Cloud computing;Radio access networks;Cellular networks;Heuristic algorithms,,19,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a dynamic traffic engineering framework, for which we develop an optimization model based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that a data center operator can use at each review point to optimally assign VN customers.

Bonaventure,25,3,1649,1662,"The support for safe network updates, i.e., live modification of device behavior without service disruption, is a critical primitive for current and future networks. Several techniques have been proposed by previous works to implement such a primitive. Unfortunately, existing techniques are not generally applicable to any network architecture, and typically require high overhead (e.g., additional memory) to guarantee strong consistency (i.e., traversal of either initial or final paths, but never a mix of them) during the update. In this paper, we deeply study the problem of computing operational sequences to safely and quickly update arbitrary networks. We characterize cases, for which this computation is easy, and revisit previous algorithmic contributions in the new light of our theoretical findings. We also propose and thoroughly evaluate a generic sequence-computation approach, based on two new algorithms that we combine to overcome limitations of prior proposals. Our approach always finds an operational sequence that provably guarantees strong consistency throughout the update, with very limited overhead. Moreover, it can be applied to update networks running any combination of centralized and distributed control-planes, including different families of IGPs, OpenFlow or other SDN protocols, and hybrid SDN networks. Our approach therefore supports a large set of use cases, ranging from traffic engineering in IGP-only or SDN-only networks to incremental SDN roll-out and advanced requirements (e.g., per-flow path selection or dynamic network function virtualization) in partial SDN deployments.",10.1109/TNET.2016.2642586,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822964,Network management;network updates;reconfiguration;hybrid SDN;theory;algorithms;simulations,Protocols;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Security;IEEE transactions;Middleboxes;Control systems,20,28,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we introduce tunable and scalable mechanisms that provide MANO with high availability and fault recovery, two reliability facets that are barely covered in the data plane dominated state-of-the-art. The mechanisms use state sharing and distributed load balancing in the context of both a centralised and distributed microservice-based architecture.

Perez,55,4,108,113,"Mobile devices have promoted users' mobility; therefore, there is a necessity to provide services that accomplish users' requirements at any place and time. With this, location becomes a key aspect of providing the dynamism required by solutions like the provisioning of reasonable mobile services by service provider networks. In that sense, the SDN paradigm arose to evolve from current static networks, which are manually configured by administrators, toward dynamic networks able to manage on their own at runtime and on demand. Solutions managing the SDN resources by using policies have been proposed, but they do not consider one of the main aspects to network dynamism: mobility. This article presents a mobility-aware and policy-based on-demand control network solution oriented to the SDN paradigm. This is in charge of managing, at runtime, the service and/or system state with high-level policies, which consider the mobility of users and services, the network statistics, and the infrastructure location. In this context, we define different use cases with the concerns of end users when they are in very crowded places, and the solutions provided by our solution through policies: balancing the network traffic between the infrastructure located close to the overloaded one; creating or dismantling geolocated virtual network infrastructure when the existing one is not enough, or is misused to meet end-user demands; and restricting specific network traffic in critical scenarios, like in sports events where crowds consume services with large bandwidth.",10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600117CM,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7901485,,Runtime;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Software defined networking;Videos,3,12,IEEE Magazines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wu,PP,99,1,1,"To accommodate different sets of network functions with different quality-of-service requirements for different types of applications in 5G networks, network slicing, which dynamically creates virtual networks, was proposed in the literature and IETF. A critical issue for network slicing is to determine the amount of resources for a network slice to ensure the quality-of-service requirement, and as such we need to determine the relationship among traffic demand, amount of resources, and end-to-end delay. This problem is non-trivial in a dynamic, virtualized environment. In this paper, we first use stochastic network calculus (SNC) to study the end-to-end delay bound with given traffic demand and resources. Then we propose a solution to find the amount of resources that should be allocated with given traffic distribution and end-to-end delay bound. Beyond that, we investigate the range of traffic demands that a network slice can support and design a learning-based dynamic network slice resizing strategy, which can significantly reduce overall resizing cost with quality-of-service guarantee.

It is challenging for the InP to determine resource allocation strategy efficiently due to the selfish strategic responses of both the MVNOs and the users. To handle this issue, we propose a tri-level Stackelberg game to jointly solve the frequency and power allocation and payment negotiation problem among the three levels.

However, decoupling the role of traditional ISPs into Infrastructure Providers (InPs) and Service Providers (SPs), also brings some new challenges to us. For example, how to fairly and efficiently share the sacred physical resources of InPs among multiple SPs is a key problem. The interaction between InPs and SPs, such as cooperation and competition, makes this topic even more complicated. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to encourage efficient behavior in solving the interaction between InPs and SPs by introducing economic incentives, in the form of Game Theory. Based on the non-cooperative game model, a bandwidth allocation scheme in the network virtualization environment is established, using the concept of the Nash Equilibrium.

The Stackelberg game approach is employed to solve the underlying hierarchical problems where the InP acts as a leader while the MVNOs play the roles of the followers.

Gu,7,,41897,41912,"Network virtualization has been widely considered to improve the resource efficiency of network infrastructure by allowing multiple virtual networks to coexist on a shared substrate network. With the exponential growth of Internet traffic, the network energy consumption incurs a considerable increase around the world. In this paper, we consider energy-aware virtual optical network embedding (EA-VONE) issue in flexible-grid elastic optical networks (EONs), while sliceable transponders (TPs) are assumed to be equipped in each node. First, an integer linear programming (ILP) model for the energy-minimized VONE is developed to optimally solve this problem. Due to the non-scalability of the ILP model, we then design two energy-saving policies for data centers (DCs) and TPs in the process of the node mapping and link mapping, respectively. Based on the two policies, two heuristic schemes are also developed: 1) DC-EA scheme, which only considers DC energy-saving in the node mapping procedure and 2) DC&TP-EA scheme, which simultaneously considers the energy-saving for both the DCs in the node mapping and TPs in the link mapping. Moreover, offline and online EA-VONE algorithms are developed. To investigate the benefits of the two energy-saving (i.e., DC-EA and DC&TP-EA) schemes, a benchmark scheme is also realized, which only maintains traffic-balancing (TB) policy without any energy-saving consideration. The simulation results indicate that our proposed DC&TP-EA scheme achieves the maximum power saving efficiency compared with the DC-EA and TB schemes. Also, in the DC-EA and DC&TP-EA schemes, the effect of DC energy saving is very remarkable when the traffic load is smaller. With the increase of traffic load, the DC energy saving may matter less, meanwhile, the TP energy-saving plays a more and more important role. Moreover, both the DC&TP-EA and DC-EA schemes maintain similar blocking performance as that of the TB scheme, which shows the superiority of our proposed schemes.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892993,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8612923,Energy efficiency;dynamic virtual optical network embedding;data center;sliceable transponder,Optical fiber networks;Power demand;Optical switches;Substrates;Resource management;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency,,21,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Papadimitriou,12,2,188,201,"The ever-increasing need to diversify the Internet has recently revived the interest in network virtualization. Wide-area virtual network (VN) deployment raises the need for VN embedding (VNE) across multiple Infrastructure Providers (InPs), due to the InP's limited geographic footprint. Multi-provider VNE, in turn, requires a layer of indirection, interposed between the Service Providers and the InPs. Such brokers, usually known as VN Providers, are expected to have very limited knowledge of the physical infrastructure, since InPs will not be willing to disclose detailed information about their network topology and resource availability to third parties. Such information disclosure policies entail significant implications on resource discovery and allocation. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of multi-provider VNE with limited information disclosure (LID). In this context, we initially investigate the visibility of VN Providers on substrate network resources and question the suitability of topology-based requests for VNE. Subsequently, we present linear programming formulations for: (i) the partitioning of traffic matrix based VN requests into segments mappable to InPs, and (ii) the mapping of VN segments into substrate network topologies. VN request partitioning is carried out under LID, i.e., VN Providers access only information which is not deemed confidential by InPs. We further investigate the suboptimality of LID on VNE against a “best-case” scenario where the complete network topology and resource availability information is available to VN Providers.",10.1109/TNSM.2015.2417652,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072477,Network virtualization;virtual network embedding;topology abstraction;virtualized infrastructures;Network virtualization;topology abstraction;virtual network embedding;virtualized infrastructures,Peer-to-peer computing;Indium phosphide;Substrates;Network topology;Bandwidth;Topology;Availability,28,34,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To accommodate a request, appropriate sensing, computing and communication resources need to be allocated across the network. Traditionally, each request is mapped to a dedicated set of resources, even when the requests are similar. The need to reduce resource usage has led to data virtualization techniques that focus primarily on merging the requests ignoring the QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a QoS-aware resource allocation approach, JudiShare, that merges requests, where possible, if they are compatible in their requirements, providing judicious reuse of both sensing and communication resources through a mixture of data virtualization and Virtual Network Embedding (VNE). We show that JudiShare respects QoS requirements and reduces resource usage to up to 60%.

Demeester,16,4,1374,1388,"The virtualization of compute and network resources enables an unseen flexibility for deploying network services. A wide spectrum of emerging technologies allows an ever-growing range of orchestration possibilities in cloud-based environments. But in this context it remains challenging to rhyme dynamic cloud configurations with deterministic performance. The service operator must somehow map the performance specification in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) to an adequate resource allocation in the virtualized infrastructure. We propose the use of a VNF profile to alleviate this process. This is illustrated by profiling the performance of four example network functions (a virtual router, switch, firewall and cache server) under varying workloads and resource configurations. We then compare several methods to derive a model from the profiled datasets. We select the most accurate method to further train a model which predicts the services’ performance, in function of incoming workload and allocated resources. Our presented method can offer the service operator a recommended resource allocation for the targeted service, in function of the targeted performance and maximum workload specified in the SLA.

EC2,Intelligent Latency-Aware Virtual Network Embedding for Industrial Wireless Networks,2019,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,M. Li; C. Chen; C. Hua; X. Guan,6,5,7484,7496,"The growing popularity of industrial wireless networks (IWNs) is driven by various applications with stringent timeliness requests. However, the ossification, deep-rooted in the one-application one-network architecture of traditional IWNs, impedes the evolution of IWNs toward smart factory. As a solution, the slice-based network virtualization (NV) breaks the tight coupling between applications and network infrastructure, and thus provides a more flexible and scalable IWN architecture. The application of NV relies on the algorithms that instantiate multiple virtual networks (VNs) on a substrate infrastructure, known as VN embedding (VNE). However, existing VNE algorithms are not necessarily optimal for IWNs due to the absence of QoS-compliant capacity. To this end, so called iVNE, an intelligent latency-aware VNE scheme, is proposed to provide deadline guarantee for various industrial VNs (IVNs), which involves both static embedding and dynamic forwarding. In the static stage, an anypath embedding algorithm is introduced for the new arrival of IVNs so that their resource demands and deadlines can be satisfied with coarse grain. Then, a dynamic anypath forwarding method is incorporated into iVNE to offer intelligent latency sensing via deep Q-learning, and thus forwarding adjustments can be made timely to address the dynamic changes of link quality and network workload. The simulation results are provided to demonstrate the learning efficiency as well as the ability of load-balancing through responsive forwarding under dynamic environment.",10.1109/JIOT.2019.2900855,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648178,Deep Q-learning;industrial wireless networks (IWNs);low-latency;network virtualization (NV);smart factory,Virtualization;Wireless networks;Quality of service;Monitoring;Substrates;Virtual machine monitors;Internet of Things,,41,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC5,A modified proportional fair radio resource management scheme in virtual RANs,2017,2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC),B. Rouzbehani; L. M. Correia; L. Caeiro,,,1,5,"This paper proposes a model for radio resource management in virtualised radio access networks, based on the criterion of proportional fairness, which is also adapted to deal with the situations when there is not enough capacity to serve all subscribers with an acceptable level of service, the so-called the extreme case. A single virtual network operator providing four different classes of services negotiates the required capacity to serve its subscribers, from a centralised entity called Virtual Radio Resource Management (VRRM). The main goals of VRRM are to maximise the utilisation of resources, while maintaining a level of fairness in the allocation of data rate among different services. However, under extreme situations, the algorithm is modified to react differently, according to the offered traffic load. In general, it keeps serving a number of users having the stringiest Quality of Service (QoS), with the minimum guaranteed data rate, while the rest of users performing lowest QoS priority services are increasingly delayed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through a practical heterogeneous network scenario and different evaluation metrics. Results show that when there is enough capacity, the algorithm is capable of satisfying the predefined service level agreements, while keeping fairness, whereas under extreme situations, it delays just enough number of users to free capacity for high priority services. In both cases, the algorithm is capable of maximising the utilisation of resources.",10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980724,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7980724,Proportional fairness;Virtualisation;VNO;VRRM,Resource management;Quality of service;Wireless networks;Delays;Network architecture;Adaptation models;Radio access networks,1,12,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the paper proposes (1) a technique to dynamically configure a vBS on top of multiple physical WiFi base stations by exploiting the features of OpenFlow, and (2) a technique of network-driven seamless handover between vBSs by forced association and authentication in advance at a target vBS. The paper also describes a detailed design and implementation of a physical WiFi base station which can organize a vBS, named virtualization capable WiFi Base Station (vcBS). As a prototype, two vcBSs and virtualization capable Base Stations Switch (vcBS-SW) to accommodate and centrally control those vcBSs are newly developed. The paper demonstrates a vBS can be dynamically configured on top of two vcBSs and the base station resource can be dynamically allocated to the vBS by assigning additional WiFi interfaces or frequency channels based on a resource allocation policy. The paper also demonstrates the proportion of SIP calls whose setup time exceed the threshold of 600ms can be reduced from 19.7% to 4.6%, when the SIP signaling traffic is served by a SIP-specific vBS.

To ensure multicasting reliable, secure and scalable, a service chain consisting of network functions (e.g., firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), and transcoders) usually is associated with each multicast request. Such a multicast request is referred to as an NFV-enabled multicast request. In this paper we study NFV-enabled multicasting in a Software-Defined Network (SDN) with the aims to minimize the implementation cost of each NFV-enabled multicast request or maximize the network throughput for a sequence of NFV-enabled requests, subject to network resource capacity constraints. We first formulate novel NFV-enabled multicasting and online NFV-enabled multicasting problems. We then devise the very first approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio of 2K for the NFV-enabled multicasting problem if the number of servers for implementing the network functions of each request is no more than a constant K (1). We also study dynamic admissions of NFV-enabled multicast requests without the knowledge of future request arrivals with the objective to maximize the network throughput, for which we propose an online algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(log n) when K = 1, where n is the number of nodes in the network.

Cao; S. Wu; F. Tian; L. Yang,,,1,6,"In the network virtualization environment, physical network resources are usually abstracted in order to be managed and allocated by telecommunication providers in a flexible manner. The virtualized resources allocation issue is called as virtual network embedding (VNE). The research of VNE attracts extensive attention from academic community. Correspondingly, multiple VNE algorithms are proposed. However, existing VNE algorithms adopt ‘one fits all’ mode to serve all different VN services, requested by end users. Different customized VN services usually have different resource and QoS demands. Adopting the ‘one fits all’ mode to serve all different VNs will eventually lead to inefficient resources utilization and low revenues of telecommunication providers. Hence, it is essential to research the service oriented virtualized resources allocation issue in network virtualization environment, aiming at efficiently map each customized VN service. In this paper, we research the service oriented resources allocation problem. A novel framework, labeled as SerOri, is proposed.

In this paper, we propose a pricingbased resource allocation strategy in virtualized CRANs, where one mobile network operator (MNO) owns the physical resource and multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) serve their users with resources leased from the MNO. The problem is naturally formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where the upper level corresponds to revenue maximization of the MNO and the lower level corresponds to the utility-surplus maximization of the MVNOs. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose to solve the MVNO problem with a low-complexity algorithm, which scales well with the network size. Based on the analysis of the revenue of the MNO, we find that different utility function families result in distinct revenue trends with respect to the price, and correspondingly propose efficient algorithms to find the optimal price that maximizes the revenue. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for the MVNO problem can reduce the complexity from O(M3) of interior point methods to O(M), where M is the number of users.

OK,Joint Spectrum Reservation and On-Demand Request for Mobile Virtual Network Operators,2018,IEEE Transactions on Communications,Y. Zhang; S. Bi; Y. A. Zhang,66,7,2966,2977,"Wireless network virtualization enables mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to develop new services on a low-cost platform by leasing virtual resources from mobile network owners. In this paper, we investigate a two-stage spectrum leasing framework, where an MVNO acquires spectrum resources through both advance reservation and on-demand request. To maximize its surplus, the MVNO needs to jointly optimize the amount of spectrum resources to lease in the two stages by taking into account traffic intensity, random user locations, wireless channel statistics, quality-of-service requirements, and the price differences. Meanwhile, to maximize the utilization of the acquired resources, the MVNO dynamically allocates the spectrum resources to its mobile subscribers (users) according to fast wireless channel fading. We formulate the MVNO's surplus maximization problem as a tri-level nested optimization problem consisting of dynamic resource allocation (DRA), on-demand request, and advance reservation subproblems. To solve the problem efficiently, we first analyze the DRA problem, and then use the optimal solution to find the optimal leasing decisions in the two stages. In particular, we derive a closed-form expression of the optimal on-demand request, and develop a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal advance reservation. For a special case when the proportional fairness utility function is adopted, we show that the optimal two-stage leasing scheme is related to the number of users and is irrelevant to user locations.

Peha,,,1,10,"Traditionally, a cell phone remains on a single, primary mobile network operator (MNO) as long as it is available, and roams onto another MNO only when outside the primary MNO's coverage. Multi-network access (MNA) is a new scheme where a cell phone may use any one of multiple MNOs at any place, anytime. One such example is a multi-operator mobile virtual network operator (MO-MVNO) like Google Fi. This paper quantifies how much MNA can reduce the cost of cellular data services, and shows that the amount of infrastructure and/or spectrum resources needed to produce a given network capacity can be reduced by over 20%. Greater resource savings can be realized if MNA-capable devices attach to towers of higher SINR rather than higher expected data rate. The amount of resources saved increases faster than linearly with increasing fraction of MNA-capable devices on the network, so as an MO-MVNO gains market share, it could demand better wholesale prices from partner MNOs.

Izquierdo-Zaragoza; P. Pavon-Marino,,,1,3,"Continuous advances in network technologies challenge network architects in their attempt to foresee what new technologies deserve resources and investments, what existing infrastructure to keep, and their interplay during migration processes. Moreover, topics like energy efficiency, disaster resilience, or SDN/NFV are being intensively considered and investigated during the last years. As a result, R&D efforts have led to a number of solutions. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for operators to reproduce such results on their networks, maybe due to divergent philosophies between commercial planning tools used in the industry and academic tools. A paradigm shift to an open-source view of network planning could emphasize the power of peer-review and transparency to promote innovation at an accelerated pace and lower cost. This tutorial would focus on Net2Plan (http://www.net2plan.com), an open-source tool developed by the authors, and actively used in several courses (>200 students) and research projects since 2012. Built on top of a technology-agnostic multilayer network representation, Net2Plan is designed to assist users in the evaluation of built-in or original user-developed planning algorithms. In addition, users can analyze their designs using either reports or a simulation tool for in-operation scenarios like network resilience, connection-admission-control, time-varying traffic resource allocation, or even combinations of them. Besides, Net2Plan permits applying algorithms to orchestrate OpenFlow-enabled networks interacting with the northbound interface of OpenDaylight. Throughout the tutorial, attendees would have the opportunity to learn about the main features of Net2Plan, also discovering some of its applications. At the end of this tutorial, attendees would be guided through an intensive hands-on case study based on an IP-over-WDM network, e.g., including network dimensioning using built-in or user-developed algorithms, WDM line engineering (e.g., EDFA placement, impairment computations), automatic availability calculation under different failure patterns, and automatic simulation of the effects of time-varying traffic and assessment of energy-efficient switch-off techniques.",10.1109/HPSR.2015.7483072,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483072,,Planning;Tutorials;Nonhomogeneous media;Open source software;Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization;Optical fiber networks,,,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Esposito,,,17,22,"Max Consensus-based Auction (MCA) protocols are an elegant approach to establish conflict-free distributed allocations in a wide range of network utility maximization problems. A set of agents independently bid on a set of items, and exchange their bids with their first hop-neighbors for a distributed (max-consensus) winner determination. MCA protocols have been proposed, e.g, To solve the task allocation problem for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles, in smart grids, or in distributed virtual network management applications. Misconfigured or malicious agents participating in a MCAor an incorrect combination of policy instantiations can lead to oscillations of the protocol, causing, e.g, Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. In this paper we propose a formal, machine-readable, Max-Consensus Auction model encoded in the Alloy light weight modeling language. The model consists of a network of agents applying the MCA mechanisms instantiated with potentially different policies, and a set of predicates to analyze its convergence properties. We were able to verify that even when all agents follow the protocol, MCA is not resilient against rebidding attacks, and that the protocol fails (to achieve a conflict-free resource allocation) for some specific combinations of policies. Our model can be used to verify, with a ""push-button"" analysis, the convergence of the MCA mechanism to a conflict-free allocation under a wide range of policy instantiations.",10.1109/ICDCSW.2015.15,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165078,Model Checking;Verification;Max-Consensus Protocol;Alloy,Protocols;Metals;Resource management;Convergence;Analytical models;Conferences;Unmanned aerial vehicles,1,26,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With consideration of factors influencing energy and spectrum efficiency, a feasible shortest path is preferred; meanwhile, an appropriate modulation format is dynamically selected according to transmission distance and the trade-off between energy and spectrum consumption. To improve the acceptance rate of virtual network requests, a dual mapping is employed to reinforce the embedding process by multi-dimensional resources integrated mapping.

One of the major research challenges in this dynamic scenario is to develop a fair flow control mechanism. This flow control problem could be partitioned into two sections, intra-VPN fairness control (internal control of aggregate flows) and inter-VPN fairness control (external control of individual sources by signals emanating from edge routers) [1]. External flow control becomes very complicated for Quality of Service (QoS) aware flows where each flow has a different minimum guaranteed rate. In this paper, firstly, we present the design of a novel QoS-aware external flow control algorithm for QoS aware flows in virtual private networks, and secondly, we present extensive NS-2 simulation results for our flow control algorithm.

This is necessary in the scenario where a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) owns the Radio Access Network (RAN) and many Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) act as resellers of their host network's capacity under their own brands, to their own customers. In such scenarios, the forecasted MVNO traffic is the basis for providing resources suitable with the corresponding MVNOs demand. To that end, the dynamic provision of resources among MVNOs should be performed in flexible, short-term time scales. In this paper, we effectively address this issue by integrating the capacity broker into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network management architecture using the minimum set of enhancements. In addition, to fully exploit its capabilities, we propose the Multi-tenant Slicing (MuSli) of capacity algorithm, to allocate resources towards MVNOs in coarse time scales.

Zhu; L. Yang,6,,78425,78436,"Network virtualization (NV) is one crucial attribute for the next-generation network. Virtual network embedding (VNE) is known to be the resource allocation problem in NV content. Since 2008, researchers have proposed multiple embedding algorithms to embed VNs onto the underlying physical networks. Considering the NP-hard nature of VNE, most of the prior algorithms focus on embedding each VN in two separated embedding stages (separated node and link embeddings). Some embedding algorithms embed each VN in one embedding stage by adopting a mixed integer linear programming approach or game theory or sub-graph isomorphism, trapped in high computation time. These algorithms embed the VN in one centralized substrate network (SN), while, in real networking environment, each VN must be embedded among multiple SNs. Each substrate node is geographically distributed in a different location. In order to address these issues, we propose a Location-Aware and Node Ranking Value Assisted embedding algorithm (labeled as LANRVA-VNE). The LANRVA-VNE conducts each VN embedding in one embedding stage. In addition, the LANRVA-VNE is able to embed each requested VN service among multiple distributed SNs in polynomial time, aiming at promoting future dynamic VN service implementation. Main evaluation results reveal that the LANRVA-VNE significantly improves VN acceptance ratio by at least 10% over the typical two-stage algorithms (e.g., VNE-NTANRC-S, RW-SP, and ViNE-SP).",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885033,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8558489,Next generation network;virtual network embedding;one embedding stage;multiple distributed substrate networks;polynomial time;future dynamic VN service implementation,Substrates;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Bandwidth;Telecommunications;Next generation networking;Solid modeling,,22,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to a lack of coordination between runtime power management and a virtual CPU (vCPU) scheduler, existing virtualized cloud platform is far from efficient. First, current frequency control mechanism is unable to satisfy the fast-changing vCPU frequency requirement imposed by vCPU scheduler, which we refer to as demand imbalance problem. In addition, newly created vCPUs, if scheduled solely based on fairness, can cause inefficient frequency rise and drop on an unmatched physical core, which we refer to as utilization mismatch problem. In both cases, the system incurs degraded power efficiency and sub-optimal workload performance. In this study we perform a comprehensive analysis on the interplay between vCPU scheduling and processor-centric power control in virtualized cloud environment. Using representative workloads from Cloud Suite and real server deployment, we examine the energy/performance implications of frequency scaling and vCPU scheduling on both single-VM and multi-VM cloud host.

To efficiently use cache resources, balancing the load across a cluster of cache servers is important. Current approaches place a proxy at each client that can redirect requests across the cluster, but this requires modification to each client and makes dynamic replication of keys difficult. While a centralized proxy can be used, this traditionally has not been scalable. We design and implement NetKV, a scalable, self-managing, load balancer for memcached clusters. NetKV exploits recent advances in Network Function Virtualization to provide efficient packet processing in software, producing a high performance, centralized proxy that can forward over 10.5 million requests per second. NetKV efficiently and accurately detects hot keys using stream-analytic techniques, then replicates them to meet the allowed load imbalance bound set by administrators. NetKV uses “balls and bins” load analysis to adaptively determine the replication factor and set of hot keys.

The spectrum is a finite resource and can accomodate a limited number of simultaneous users at one time. Due to this scarcity, allocating traditional mobile licenses to new mobile operators is unrealizable and new entrants should bargain access to the networks of the incumbents. In this article, a mobile network operator (MNO) shares his finite network resource with a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) lacking the infrastructure. This latter has the opportunity to invest in advertising/content to compensate for her quality of service degradation.

Ramakrishnan,,,396,404,"Real-time applications such as autonomous and connected cars, surveillance, and online learning applications have to train on streaming data. They require low-latency, high throughput machine learning (ML) functions resident in the network and in the cloud to perform learning and inference. NFV on edge cloud platforms can provide support for these applications by having heterogeneous computing including GPUs and other accelerators to offload ML-related computation. GPUs provide the necessary speedup for performing learning and inference to meet the needs of these latency sensitive real-time applications. Supporting ML inference and learning efficiently for streaming data in NFV platforms has several challenges. In this paper, we present a framework, NetML, that runs existing ML applications on an heterogeneous NFV platform that includes both CPUs and GPUs. NetML efficiently transfers the appropriate packet payload to the GPU, minimizing overheads, avoiding locks, and avoiding CPU-based data copies. Additionally, NetML minimizes latency by maximizing overlap between the data movement and GPU computation. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach for training and inference using popular object detection algorithms on our platform. NetML reduces the latency for inferring images by more than 20% and increases the training throughput by 30% while reducing CPU utilization compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives.",10.1109/NETSOFT.2019.8806698,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8806698,,Graphics processing units;Servers;Noise measurement;Computational modeling;Instruction sets;Throughput;Cloud computing,,38,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, HPC systems are dynamic with multiple jobs coming and leaving in an unpredictable fashion, sharing simultaneously the system interconnection network. In such environment contention for network resources is causing random stalls in the progress of application execution degrading application and system performance overall. Eliminating job interactions in their neighbourhoods is key for guaranteeing performance predictability of applications. In this paper we are proposing the concept of quiet neighbourhoods that significantly reduce job interactions. Quiet neighbourhoods are created by the system resource manager in two phases.

Whereas a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms have attempted to address this issue from different aspects, the challenge still remains for mapping VNs across multiple network domains which only maintain partial information of the overall substrate network. A novel hierarchical algorithm to address this issue by formulating such VN mapping problem as a hierarchical linear programme model has been presented. Through the use of the primal decomposition and subgradient optimisation technique, in conjunction with the proposed hierarchical algorithm, the substrate network resource can be appropriately allocated to the VN instances with enhanced scalability, because of the parallelism in individual domains. In addition, the algorithm could find the best trade-off between the number of optimisation iterations (computation time) and cost by selecting an appropriate number of iterations. The proposed method has been assessed through a collection of numerical simulation experiments for a range of network scenarios and the result shows that nearly optimal performance as well as improved VN mapping request acceptance ratio and revenue can be achieved.",10.1049/iet-com.2011.0395,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356123,,,2,,IET Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miorandi; A. Ghiribaldi; S. M. Nowick; D. Bertozzi,,,1,6,"In on-chip interconnection networks, performance optimization techniques can be often achieved in two opposite ways: by making control logic more complex inside switches, or by pushing design complexity to the switch boundaries. The implementation of virtual channel (VC) flow control is an important application domain of this design trade-off. The data path of VC switches typically exhibits replicated buffers. The underlying philosophy (i.e., resource replication) can be pushed to the limit, thus incuring an apparently high area cost, while simplifying the switch control path. On the other hand, unreplicated resources require complex control logic for the sake of their efficient sharing among virtual networks. Investigating this design tradeoff is especially important for asynchronous networks, where the synthesis of complex control circuits is a challenge.

Unfortunately, over time, and due to the frequent initiation and termination of VNs, the available and utilized SN resources become fragmented. This in turn, gradually degrades the performance of these techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel proactive SN resource re-optimization technique that efficiently overcomes the fragmentation problem by performing appropriate re-arrangement, or house cleaning, for the available and utilized SN resources. To minimize the incurred computational overhead, the invocation of this technique is only triggered by certain events such as the departure of an expired VN.

As it is practically impossible to know future traffic arrival and channel information, we employ the Lyapunov Optimization to develop an online resource provision algorithm. The proposed online algorithm performs joint subcarrier and power allocation to each slice based on the traffic information, wireless channel state as well as historical resource provision.

The contributions of this article are two-fold; first, we introduce a new time-of-use pricing policy for the SN resources that reflects the effect of resource congestion introduced by VN users. The preferences of the VN users are first represented through corresponding demand-utility functions that quantify the sensitivity of the applications hosted by the VNs to resource consumption, time-of-use and prices during peak-demand periods. We then introduce a novel model of time-varying VNs, where users are allowed to up- or down-scale the requested resources to continuously maximize their utility while minimizing the cost of embedding the VNs onto the SN. The second contribution is a novel hierarchical embedding management approach tailored to efficiently map these dynamic VNs. The proposed VN embedding scheme recasts the VN embedding problem as a subgraph matching one, and introduces a simple heuristics-based matching procedure to find a good VN embedding from a number of candidate solutions obtained in parallel. In contrast to existing solutions, the proposed scheme does not impose any limitations on the size or topology of the VN requests. Instead, the search is customized according to the VN size and the associated utility.

VN mapping is a resource-allocation problem where fractions of the resources (e.g., bandwidth and processing) in the physical infrastructure (e.g., optical network and servers/data-centers) are provisioned for specific applications. Researchers have been studying the survivable VN mapping (SVNM) problem against physical-infrastructure failures (typically by deterministic failure models), because this type of failure may disconnect one or more VNs, and/or reduce their capacities. However, disasters can cause multiple link/node failures which may disconnect many VNs and dramatically increase the post-disaster vulnerability to correlated cascading failures. Hence, we investigate the disaster-resilient and post-disaster-survivable VN mapping problem using a probabilistic model to reduce the expected VN disconnections and capacity loss, while providing an adaptation to minimize VN disconnections by any postdisaster single-physical-link failure.

Cloud-RAN(C-RAN) and densely deployed small cells are two of the tools at disposal of mobile network operators to cope with such challenges. In order to mitigate the fronthaul requirements imposed by the C-RAN architecture, several functional splits, each characterized by a different demarcation point between the centralized and the distributed units, have emerged. However, the selection of the appropriate centralization level (i.e., the functional split) still remains a challenging task, since a number of parameters have to be considered in order to make such a decision. In this paper, a virtual network embedding (VNE) algorithm is proposed to flexibly select the appropriate functional split for each small cell. The VNE is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem whose objective is to jointly minimize the inter-cell interference and the fronthaul bandwidth utilization by dynamically selecting the appropriate functional split.

Secondly, we enhance the VN with additional computing and communication resources and design the Enhanced VN (or EVN) before embedding it to the substrate in order to further reduce the amount of substrate resources needed to survive a single facility node failure.

Packet-level simulation is necessary to test and analyze these systems, such as grids, peer-to-peer (P2P) applications as well as worm and DDoS containment systems. However, the current network simulators are not convenient for application layer simulation. We present the NSME, a visualized parallel simulator that allows researchers to simulate their applications in a large virtual network with most details transparent to them. A hierarchical routing is used to enhance the fidelity of simulation and reduce the memory cost of network construction. A variation of CMB algorithm is implemented for parallel synchronization. We show the functions of NSME by three applications: 1) a self-similar background traffic model, 2) a Slammer worm spreading model, and 3) a P2P live streaming system, which demonstrate its effectiveness for simulating any large-scale distributed applications. The performance tests show that the memory cost of NSME is distinctly lower than NS2 and the parallel efficiency can reach about 60% in any of the above applications.",10.1109/PDCAT.2007.35,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420188,,Visualization;Large-scale systems;Computational modeling;Peer to peer computing;Costs;Network topology;Distributed computing;System testing;Routing;Parallel programming,3,13,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC4,Computing and Bandwidth Resource Allocation in Multi-Provider NFV Environment,2018,IEEE Communications Letters,V. Eramo; F. G. Lavacca,22,10,2060,2063,We propose an algorithm for the cloud and bandwidth resource allocation in multi-provider NFV environments. The resources are allocated so as to take into account the different costs charged by the cloud infrastructure providers (InP). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed from the comparison with the results of the optimal problem. Its application in medium and large networks has shown that it can lead to cost saving as high as 65% with respect to algorithms that allocate resources without taking into account the cost differences charged by the InPs.,10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2864101,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428637,Network function virtualization;computing resources;bandwidth resources;least cost path,Cloud computing;Bandwidth;Delays;Indium phosphide;III-V semiconductor materials;Resource management;Integer linear programming,6,8,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Performance-hungry and safety-critical applications (like a radar processing system steering an autonomous flying aircraft) may demand an embedded high-performance computing cluster of more than one (multi-core) processor. This paper presents the Multi-Processor I/O Virtualization (MPIOV) concept to enable hardware-based Input/Output (I/O) virtualization or sharing with separation among multiple (multi-core) processors in (mixed-criticality) embedded real-time systems, which usually do not have means for separation like an Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). The concept uses a Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) to connect each processing host to the management host, while checking the target address and source / origin ID to decide whether or not to block a transaction. It is a standardized, portable and non-proprietary platform-independent spatial separation solution that does not require an IOMMU in the processor. Furthermore, the concept sketches an approach for PCI Express (PCIe)-based systems to enable sharing of up to 2048 (virtual) functions per endpoint, while still being compatible to the plain PCIe standard.

It circumvents a virtually fatal tradeoff in large-scale neural hardware between model support limitations or scalability limitations, without imposing a synchronous timing model. The chip itself combines an array of general-purpose processors with a configurable asynchronous interconnect and memory fabric to achieve true on- and off-chip parallelism, universal network architecture support, and programmable temporal dynamics. An HDL-like concurrent configuration software model using libraries of templates, allows the user to embed the neural model onto the hardware, mapping the virtual network structure and time dynamics into physical on-chip components and delay specifications.

Qin,,,1,7,"Network slicing enables diversified services to be carried in isolated slices. To maintain the quality of service and achieve high profit of a slice in dynamic environments, it is vital to agilely reconfigure the resource allocation for the slice. However, frequent reconfigurations also incur certain cost and might cause service interruption. To maximize the slice's profit and reduce the reconfiguration overhead, we propose a fast slice reconfiguration (FSR) scheme to cope with small traffic variations of individual slices at the time scale of flow arrival/departure. Due to small traffic variations, the FSR only reconfigures bandwidth and VNF capacity allocation for partial flows. We formulate the optimization problem for FSR, which is difficult to solve due to the discontinuity and non-convexity of the reconfiguration cost function. We propose to approximate the reconfiguration cost function with L1 norm, which preserves the sparsity of solution, thus avoiding unnecessary reconfigurations. Besides, the FSR problem should be solved efficiently, so that slices could be reconfigured timely. Hence, we exploit the dual-ADMM method to solve the problem in a distributed manner for large slices.

Practical deadlock avoidance techniques can be classified into two main categories, requiring either a segregation of traffic in non-cyclic virtual networks or some form of injection control. Simulating large high-dimension tori networks using application traffic is challenging. Most proposals use either large low-dimension tori, or synthetic traffic. Currently, tori of five and six dimensions are being used in actual supercomputers, such as the Fujitsu K Computer, which was ranked first in the Top 500 in two consecutive lists (June 2011 and November 2011).

A naive approach is to broadcast a request to a set of banks that might possibly contain the copy of a block. However, this approach is wasteful in terms of energy and bandwidth. Hence, we propose a novel scheme in this paper, TSI, which proposes to create a set of virtual networks (overlays) of cache banks over a physical optical NOC. We search for a block inside each overlay using a combination of multicast and unicast messages. We additionally create support for our overlay networks by proposing optimizations to the previously proposed R-SWMR network. We also propose a set of novel hardware structures for creating and managing overlays, and for efficiently locating blocks in the overlay.

Schmid,,,1,9,"Many resource allocation problems in the cloud can be described as a basic Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP): the problem of finding a mapping of a request graph (describing a workload) onto a substrate graph (describing the physical infrastructure). Applications range from mapping testbeds (from where the problem originated), over the embedding of batch-processing workloads (virtual clusters) to the embedding of service function chains. The different applications come with their own specific requirements and constraints, including node mapping constraints, routing policies, and latency constraints. While the VNEP has been studied intensively over the last years, complexity results are only known for specific models and we lack a comprehensive understanding of its hardness. This paper charts the complexity landscape of the VNEP by providing a systematic analysis of the hardness of a wide range of VNEP variants, using a unifying and rigorous proof framework. In particular, we show that the problem of finding a feasible embedding is NP-complete in general, and, hence, the VNEP cannot be approximated under any objective, unless P = NP holds. Importantly, we derive NP-completeness results also for finding approximate embeddings, which may violate, e.g., capacity constraints by certain factors.

Muppala,,,714,718,Network virtualization is considered to be not only an enabler to overcome the inflexibility of the current Internet infrastructure but also an enabler to achieve an energy-efficient Future Internet. Virtual network embedding (VNE) is a critical issue in network virtualization technology. This paper explores a joint power-aware node and link resource allocation approach to handle the VNE problem with the objective of minimizing energy consumption. We first present a generalized power consumption model of embedding a VN. Then we formulate the problem as a mixed integer program and propose embedding algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform better than the existing algorithms in terms of the power consumption in the overprovisioned scenarios.,10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477662,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477662,Network virtualization;Virtual network embedding;Energy consumption;Optimization;Resource allocation,Power demand;Substrates;Energy consumption;Bandwidth;Mathematical model;Internet;Simulation,16,18,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Casellas; R. Martínez; R. Vilalta; R.

Such controllers do export and expose interfaces for the limited control of abstracted resources and operations via north-bound interface (NBI) to operations/business support systems (OSS/BSS), but such APIs are often vendor specific and internal control aspects related to provisioning, monitoring and resource management remain proprietary and not disclosed.Disaggregation of optical networks refers to a deployment model of optical systems, by composing and assembling open, available components, devices and sub-systems. This disaggregation is driven by multiple factor (the mismatch between the needs of operators and the ability to deliver adapted solutions by vendors or the increase in hardware commoditization) and disaggregated networks are an excellent use case for open and standard interfaces, showing the benefits of a unified, model-driven development.In this paper, we address the SDN control of a disaggregated optical networks and its role in a wider Control Management and Orchestration (COM) architecture to offer ETSI NFV Network Services in a metropolitan infrastructure, characterized by multiple geographical locations and NFVI.

Recent works have focused on identifying elephant flows and rerouting them to improve network utilization. These approaches however require either a significant monitoring overhead or hardware/end-host modifications. In this paper, we propose FlowSeer, a fast, low-overhead elephant flow detection and scheduling system using data stream mining. Our key idea is that the features from flows' first few packets allow us to train the streaming classification models that can accurately and quickly predict the rate and duration of any initiated flow. With these predicted information, FlowSeercan adapt routing polices of elephant flows to their demands and dynamic network conditions. Another nice property of FlowSeeris its capability of enabling the controller and switches to perform cooperative prediction. Most of decisions can be made by switches locally, thereby reducing both detection latency and signaling overhead. FlowSeerrequires less than 100 flow table entries at each switch to enable cooperative prediction, and hence can be implemented on off-the-shelf switches. The evaluation via both experiments in realistic virtual networks and trace-driven simulations shows that FlowSeerimproves the throughput by multiple times over Hedera, which pulls flow statistics, and performs comparably to Mahout, which needs end-host modification.",10.1109/TSC.2016.2597846,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7549048,Flow classification;streaming mining;software defined data center networks,Data mining;Bandwidth;Hardware;Predictive models;Routing;Data models;Mice,3,41,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, traditional model-based optimization methods usually follow some assumptions and impose certain limitations. In this paper, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement learning in solving complicated control problems, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) based algorithm. We first formulate the NUM problem with the consideration of end-to-end delays and various operation costs into a non-convex optimization problem and prove it to be NP-hard. We then redesign the exploration method and invent a dual replay buffer structure to customize the DDPG. Meanwhile, we also apply our formulation to guide our replay buffer update.

In this respect, NOMA provides a suitable opportunity for the MVNO to share resources among SPs more efficiently. Regarding interaction among the DL rates provided for SPs we formulate our resource allocation problem as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) while taking into account user fairness. By using the weighted Tchebycheff technique, we are able to solve the formulated MOOP by considering different tradeoffs among DL rates of different SPs. Our numerical results show that by using NOMA, each SP gains a higher rate compared with orthogonal frequency-division multiple access.",10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2875686,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8490894,Virtualized wireless network (VWN);NOMA;multiobjective optimization;rate tradeoff,NOMA;Optimization;Interference;Downlink;Resource management;Silicon carbide;Virtualization,,13,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EC5,An Autonomous Service-Oriented Orchestration Framework for Software Defined Mobile Networks,2019,"2019 22nd Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks and Workshops (ICIN)",X. Dang; M. A. Khan; F. Sivrikaya,,,277,284,"5G network evolution results in new challenges for mobile network management and orchestration. The emerging SDN and NFV technologies are transforming the network infrastructure and network service components into compositions of programmable virtualized functions. The resulting flexibility allows the network to be conceived as services, which are aware of vertical application QoS/QoE requirements. While most recent works focus on flexible network control and improved resource utilization in emerging mobile network architectures, an end-to-end orchestration of both network infrastructure and vertical application is not adequately explored. In this work, we identify the challenges and propose a service oriented framework for application-aware end-to-end mobile network orchestration. We also present a prototypical realization of the proposed framework, which is an orchestration platform for virtualized mobile networks. To address the challenges of multi-stakeholder and multi-layer mobile network architecture, we employ event calculus for modeling the network layers, and abductive reasoning approach for autonomous policy translation and service provisioning in a 2-phase algorithm. The framework is validated with a 5G enhanced mobility management application as a service on our software defined mobile network testbed. Initial performance measurements are analyzed for practical insights into the proposed framework, as well as suggestions for its future development.",10.1109/ICIN.2019.8685919,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685919,Autonomous Network Management;Service Oriented Networking;Network as a Service;Network Service Model,,,22,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are many issues when deep learning is employed in SDN, for example, sampling and classifying traffic data consume a lot of IO and computing resources of the SDN controller. In this paper, we deploy the Deep Neural Network (DNN) on Virtualized Network Function (VNF) to solve the problems of applying deep learning in SDN.

In this sense we propose a hybrid orchestration approach, which unites the advantages of online heuristic and offline optimizing service orchestration methods, with the goal of obtaining a system design that provides fast service placement decisions and efficient long-term operation.

The focus is on the use of virtual management and orchestration features to drive the various network resources in response to the load changes at the RAN and distributing traffi c between various cloud entities. The NFV transformation is gaining incredible momentum within mobile operators as one of the prominent solutions to improve the resource allocation and system scalability in future fi fth generation (5G) networks. The process of migrating proprietary hardware solutions to the NFV domain creates a complete new cycle of dynamic service management that can adapt in response to users’ behavior and resource availability. Virtual appliances, denoted as virtual machines (VMs), are normally dependent on the underlying cloud hardware through a thin software layer that abstracts virtual resources to NFV applications. 5G networks will adopt a distributed cloud architecture that supports local processing of user requests within mobile edge computing (MEC) data centers.

On the other hand, the underlying networking has been the focus of a huge transformation enabled by new models resulting from virtualization and cloud computing. This has led to a number of novel architectures supported by emerging technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and more recently, edge cloud and fog networking, or network slicing [1], [2]. This evolution towards enhanced design opportunities along with increasing complexity in networking and its applications has fueled the need for improved network automation in agile infrastructures.

EC6,Keynote topic: Network cloudification: SDN-NFV and 5G-MEC with edge and fog computing,2017,2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC),Y. Lin,,,1,8,"The second wave of cloud computing, named network cloudification, in the forms of SDN (Software Defined Networking), NFV (Network Function Virtualization), and 5G-MEC (Mobile Edge Computing), is to centralize and virtualize networking into data centers. It enables operators to offer NaaS (Networking as a Service) with much lower CAPEX and OPEX with larger flexibility because devices become simpler, the number of administrators is less, and service orchestration is easier. It turns parts of communications currently done in hardware into computing done in software. However, the host of these data centers would not be Google-like super data centers as they are too far away from subscribers. The latency requirement of 10ms and 1ms decentralizes cloud computing down to edge and fog computing with CORD (central offices re-architected as data centers) and cellular base stations for SDN-NFV and 5G-MEC, respectively. In this talk, we first argue why, where and when SDN, NFV, 5G-MEC would prevail, and then illustrate how to make it happen with OpenFlow, SC (Service Chaining), NSH (Network Service header), etc. Then we examine how latency requirement dominates this virtualization game by listing key questions to answer in resource allocation in the architectures of SDN, NFV, and 5G-MEC. Their answers are mostly unknown now but would benefit the architects and developers of OpenFlow switches, SDN controllers, SDN-NFV apps, NFV data centers, MEC-enabled base stations, and operator's infrastructure in general.",10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215347,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215347,,,1,,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EC6,Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities,2017,2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP),,,,xi,xiv,"In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of Dny for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.",10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8075923,,,,,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
